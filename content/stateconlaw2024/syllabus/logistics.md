## Contact information
Colin.Doyle@lls.edu <br>
Office: Burns 315 <br>
Telephone: 213-736-1148

Email is my preferred method of communication. I do not regularly check my phone voicemail. If you have something important to communicate, use email.

Please note that although you may email me substantive questions, I typically do not answer substantive questions in an individual email reply. I prefer to answer substantive questions during office hours or immediately after class. If your question is of general interest, I will share my answer with the entire class.

My faculty assistant is Chris Galvan, and his email is: [chris.galvan@lls.edu](mailto:chris.galvan@lls.edu)

## Class schedule

Tuesdays & Thursdays from  8:45am to 10:00am<br>AC-202 (Courtroom of the '90s)

## Open office hours


Fridays from 11:00am to 12:00pm <br>
Outside the Robinson Moot Courtroom

During open office hours, any student or group of students from our class may stop by without an appointment. Anyone in the class is welcome to join or leave during that time. Please know that I _love_ office hours. While I am always up for talking about state constitutional law, I am also happy to talk about anything you’re interested in discussing: navigating law school, legal careers, the research I’m conducting when I’m not teaching, the latest season of the Great British Bakeoff — anything is fair game. My office hours are during lunchtime, so feel free to bring your lunch and eat as we chat. Sometimes I'll even have cookies or brownies to share. Show up to find out.

## One-on-one office hours
By appointment in Burns 315. To schedule an appointment, [email me](mailto:colin.doyle@lls.edu?subject=One-on-One%20Office%20Hours).

Please note that open office hours are the norm, and one-on-one office hours are the exception. If you have a question about state constitutional law or about the class itself, I recommend that you ask this question during open office hours. One-on-one office hours are available for students who cannot attend open office hours or who wish to have a private conversation.
