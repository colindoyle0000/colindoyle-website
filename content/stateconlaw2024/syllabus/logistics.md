## Contact information
Colin.Doyle@lls.edu <br>
Office: Burns 315 <br>
Telephone: 213-736-1148

Email is my preferred method of communication. I do not regularly check my phone voicemail. If you have something important to communicate, use email.

Please note that although you may email me substantive questions, I typically do not answer substantive questions in an individual email reply. I prefer to answer substantive questions during office hours or immediately after class. If your question is of general interest, I will share my answer with the entire class.

My faculty assistant is Chris Galvan, and his email is: [chris.galvan@lls.edu](mailto:chris.galvan@lls.edu)

## Class schedule

Tuesdays & Thursdays from  1:10pm to 3:10pm<br>AC-202 (Courtroom of the '90s)

## One-on-one office hours
By appointment in Burns 315. To schedule an appointment, [email me](mailto:colin.doyle@lls.edu?subject=One-on-One%20Office%20Hours).

Please note that open office hours are the norm, and one-on-one office hours are the exception. If you have a question about state constitutional law or about the class itself, I recommend that you ask this question during open office hours. One-on-one office hours are available for students who cannot attend open office hours or who wish to have a private conversation.
