The casebook for this class is *State Constitutional Law: The Modern Experience* (Fifth Edition) by Jeffrey S. Sutton & Stephen R. McAllister.

The reading assignments are listed below. To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have posted a reading assignment for a particular day, I will not change the assignment by adding more reading for that day.
