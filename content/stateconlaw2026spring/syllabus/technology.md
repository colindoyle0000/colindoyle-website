## Laptops in Class
I am reluctant to allow laptops to be used in the classroom. Laptops invite distraction, both for the student using the laptop and the students sitting nearby. At the same time, I recognize that many students prefer to take notes on their computers, that typing handwritten notes can be arduous, and that a “no laptops” policy creates a bureacratic hurdle for students who need accommodations.

I am allowing laptops to be used during class for taking notes. If I find that laptops are proving to be too much of a distraction, that policy will change. If you choose to use a laptop in class, I ask that you only use the laptop for taking notes and looking at your reading assignments. You should turn off notifications, close your email, and minimize your browser windows.

## Course Website
You're on the course website right now. I may also use our course [Brightspace page](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/292881/Home) to make announcements and to host content that cannot be shared publicly.

## Class Recordings

The Instructional Technology Department will post video recordings of class as soon as the video files have been received and processed.

Following the first day of class, I will give each student access to a shared folder that I maintain that contains audio recordings and automated transcriptions of each of our class sessions.

Please note that you are not allowed to record or share all or a portion of classes at Loyola Law School (video, audio, or photo) without the express permission of your instructor or the law school administration.

## Slides
In general, I will post a copy of my [slides](/stateconlaw2026spring/course-content/slides) to this website in the afternoon following our class.
