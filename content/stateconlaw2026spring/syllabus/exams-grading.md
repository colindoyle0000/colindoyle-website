This course is worth three credits. The course will be graded anonymously.

Your grade will be based on a final exam. The final exam will be open book. We will discuss the details of the exam later in the semester. 

Exam logistics are handled by the [Office of the Registrar](https://www.lls.edu/academics/officeoftheregistrar/), not by me. Because grading is anonymous, the law school has adopted rules and procedures to protect student anonymity during the grading process. Under these rules, I am prohibited from learning about any logistical issues related to your exams. Please avoid making comments that would jeopardize your anonymity and do not include your student identification number on any communication with me. If you have questions about exam scheduling and accommodations, or if any problem arises during the administration of an exam, contact the Registrar at [registrar@lls.edu](mailto:registrar@lls.edu) or 213-736-1130 and **do not** include me in this communication.

I reserve the right to reduce grades for poor class participation due to repeated instances of unpreparedness, lack of attention in class, refusal to participate in good faith, and absences. Any decision to reduce a grade for poor class participation is at my discretion and is non-negotiable.
