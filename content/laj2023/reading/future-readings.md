## Lesson 01 - Jan. 18

### The scope and scale of legal algorithms

Our first class will address some foundational questions. 

- Why does this class exist and why are you taking it? 
- How are algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning already affecting legal decision-making? What are the benefits? What concerns does this development raise?

In prior versions of this course, I’ve devoted time on the first day for students to introduce themselves and share what topics they’re interested in learning about in the class. I’d still like to take the time for you to introduce yourselves. But I have an additional assignment I’d like you to do before class. 

_Assignment:_

Part One: Instead of sharing aloud with the class what you’d like to get out of the class, I’d like you to ask [GPT-3][2] — a language processing model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text — to write your introduction to this class based upon your background and interests. On the first day, each student will share with the rest of the class the personal introduction that GPT-3 has crafted for them — along with any commentary you may have about GPT-3’s statements. In turn, I will share with the class GPT-3’s vision of a class entitled “Law, Justice, and Algorithms” and share how our class differs from the AI model’s prediction.

Part Two: Use some of the language from the introduction that GPT-3 has created for you as a prompt for [Dall-E][3] to create an image.

Please email me both the GPT-3 text and the Dall-E image as part of your reading response. You are welcome to create multiple versions and send me your preferred text and image.

## Lesson 02 - Jan. 25

### An introduction to machine learning

In this class, we will discuss how the field of machine learning has developed, what it looks like now, and how it may look in the future. With a firmer understanding of what machine learning is, we can address the question of whether we need distinct legal or regulatory frameworks for governing algorithmic decision-making systems or whether the “law of the algorithm” is an unnecessarily specific instance of more general principles.

## Lesson 04 - Feb. 8

### Fairness and discrimination

Recent developments in A.I. and machine learning raise questions about how fairness, equality, and nondiscrimination should be understood, defined, assessed, and advanced. As you make your way through this week’s readings, keep the following questions in mind:

- What are the contrasting conceptions of fairness at work in these different sources? 
- How should we reconcile competing concerns of accuracy and equity?
- How should an understanding of historic and systemic inequality influence the approach to incorporating machine learning into legal decision-making?
- Do risk scores pose the same or different problems depending on the decision-making context (e.g., access to credit, eligibility for pretrial release without bail, parole eligibility, policing, child welfare, and so on)?

## Lesson 05 - Feb. 15

### Prediction and probability

Many legal concepts and practices are rooted in the language and logic of prediction and probability. Before issuing a preliminary injunction, a judge must predict whether the plaintiffs will win their case on the merits. Police must have probable cause for many arrests, searches, and seizures to be constitutionally permissible. Child welfare agencies triage investigations of suspected neglect based on predictions of which claims will be substantiated, while public housing authorities manage waitlists for housing based on predictions of who will use public housing for the shortest length of time before living independently.

Across legal systems nationwide, algorithmic predictions are replacing or informing predictions traditionally made by humans. Today, algorithms can deny a person government food benefits, send a social worker to investigate a home, or ban a person from flying on commercial airlines. In many places, criminal procedure is now algorithmic from start to finish. Based on predictions of wrongdoing, algorithms encourage police to investigate, judges to incarcerate, probation to surveil, and parole boards to deny release.

As you go through this week’s readings, ask yourself about the compatibility of traditional legal concepts and emerging algorithmic systems. How much is a legal idea like “probable cause” governed by our understanding of probability? As we develop or encounter systems that consider probability much more rigorously than judges or police traditionally would, how much should statistical thinking govern our decision-making? Are there some legal concepts that can be reduced to numerical probability and some that should not be understood in purely probabilistic terms? Why? When is it fair to make a legal judgment that depends upon a prediction about someone based on that person’s similarity to a broader group? Is it ever possible to make a prediction about someone that doesn’t rely upon their similarity to a broader group?

## Lesson 06 - Feb. 22

### Case study on risk assessments

What was your attitude toward risk assessments before doing these readings? What changed and why?

If you had to align yourself with one of the authors or between multiple authors, who would they be? How would your perspective differ from theirs?

What do you think of the “perfect is the enemy of good” argument from the “Open Letter”? Does your answer depend on a conception of risk assessments as either a positive incremental change or a distraction from other interventions?

What do you make of Mayson’s argument to use risk assessments to predict needs and intervene in positive ways?
Mayson’s article leaves out what to do for pretrial incarceration in the absence of risk assessments. How do you expect that the open letter authors would respond? Would you buy their response? How would you approach the challenge that Mayson leaves unanswered?

## Lesson 07 - Mar. 15 (rescheduled)

### Transparency, interpretability, and explainability

In this session we will discuss different approaches to achieve explainability, both from a legal and technical perspective. We will learn about the difference between interpretable algorithms and non-interpretable algorithms, and the difference between transparency ex-ante and transparency ex-post including different auditing methods. We will also discuss the tradeoff between transparency and accuracy, and how balance between the two can be achieved. 

Questions to consider:

- Does a requirement of transparency or explanation in the use of algorithms in decision-making promote fairness? 
- How would it work and what would be limitations? 
- How should different legal contexts require different transparency practices?

## Lesson 08 - Mar. 22

### Regulation Part One

This class and the next will exam legal regimes that could be used to govern or regulate the use of algorithms. Our first class will examine the “Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights” that the White House put out this past fall and also the challenge of regulating deep fakes.

As A.I. and machine learning proliferates, what regulations are required? Are our institutions up to the task or is technology’s disruptive power overblown? Where might governmental oversight succeed and where might it fail? What would underegulation and overregulation look like in this space? How could we measure it? What existing rights should the government protect? What new rights ought to be protected in an age of automation?

## Lesson 09 - Mar. 29

### Large Language Models

The main assignment for this week is to experiment with Chat-GPT. You will need to creat an account with Open AI, but you can access Chat-GPT in your browser at: [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat). As you go through your week, just keep it open as a tab in your browser, and experiment with using the tool to answer different questions. In particular, explore how it might be used for law school and legal tasks. Watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbgJDL4DJ7M)  to learn how to provide ChatGPT with stronger prompts.

What are the possible benefits and drawbacks of large language models like GPT-4 for legal education and the legal profession? How can law schools best integrate these technologies into legal education? How can lawyers best integrate these technologies into legal work?

How might the widespread adoption of large language models in the legal profession affect the job market for lawyers and other legal professionals? Will these technologies complement or replace traditional legal roles?

To what extent should large language models be regulated within the legal profession? Can large language models be held accountable for providing incorrect or misleading legal advice? How can we ensure that AI technologies maintain the ethical standards of the legal profession?

## Lesson 10 - Apr. 5

### Critical Approaches

In this class we’ll be examining critical approaches to algorithmic fairness that challenge the assumptions of the literature we’ve read so far and offer sometimes radical reconceptions of the role that algorithms can play in law and society.

As you work through the readings this week, take note of what critiques and perspectives resonate with you — even if you disagree with the broader argument of an article. In our class discussion, we’ll work on synthesizing these critiques and continuing the work of imagining algorithmic alternatives.

## Lesson 07 - Mar. 1
### Transparency, interpretability, and explainability
In this session we will discuss different approaches to achieve explainability, both from a legal and technical perspective. We will learn about the difference between interpretable algorithms and non-interpretable algorithms, and the difference between transparency ex-ante and transparency ex-post including different auditing methods. We will also discuss the tradeoff between transparency and accuracy, and how balance between the two can be achieved. We will match between different transparency methods and their relevant policy domains, and become familiar with legal concepts such as due process and fair trial; as well as the legal limitations that demand a certain form of transparency. 
- Does a requirement of transparency or explanation in the use of algorithms in decision-making promote fairness? 
- How would it work and what would be limitations?

## Lesson 08 - Mar. 22
### Regulation Part One
This class and the next will exam legal regimes that could be used to govern or regulate the use of algorithms. Our first class will examine the “Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights” that the White House put out this past fall and also the challenge of regulating deep fakes.

As A.I. and machine learning proliferates, what regulations are required? Are our institutions up to the task or is technology’s disruptive power overblown? Where might governmental oversight succeed and where might it fail? What would underegulation and overregulation look like in this space? How could we measure it? What existing rights should the government protect? What new rights ought to be protected in an age of automation?

## Lesson 09 - Mar. 29
### Regulation Part Two


Our second class on regulating algorithms will focus on product liability, using self-driving cars as our case study. Product liability emerged, in part, from the increasing complexity of the supply chain of modern goods and the inherent harm certain products could cause. Is the same approach — or an analogous one — appropriate for dealing with the increasing complexity of algorithms? Or should algorithms be treated like human services? Is there a viable third option, such as universal insurance for harms caused by autonomous vehicles?

Product liability in general, and strict product liability specifically, represent an attempt to regulate the creation and sale of goods by imposing liability for harms caused. Is a regulation-by-incentive approach effective? Is it appropriate for the regulation of algorithms? Where might incentives to create safe, ethical algorithms and artificial intelligences break down? What are other model of assigning redress for the harms caused by technologies such as autonomous vehicles?

## Lesson 10 - Apr. 5
### Litigation
In this class session, we'll be looking at the impact of algorithms in three areas of decision-making that are traditionally protected by civil rights laws: housing, lending, and employment. In the first part of class, we'll consider why private actors might want to use algorithms in housing, lending, and employment decision-making and how those uses might interact with civil rights statutes. On one hand, it seems like algorithmic decision-making is a cure for intentional and unintentional discrimination in _human_ decision-making. On the other hand, empirical studies show that algorithmic decision-making can exhibit bias against protected characteristics such as race or gender, even when these characteristics have been scrubbed from input datasets. What are the tradeoffs between algorithmic and human decision-making when it comes to decisions that disparately impact protected classes? Do we (or should we) think about these tradeoffs differently in the areas of housing, lending, and employment? Readings for this part of class are:

For the second part of class, we'll look at potential legal interventions that could address, at least partially, the issue of algorithmic discrimination. Assuming that we find _some_ benefit to algorithmic decision-making (and thus don't opt for an out-right ban), how do we preserve the good while regulating the bad? Should a regulatory agency be nominated - or created - to oversee the deployment of algorithms in areas protected by civil rights laws? Should we create a private right of action against algorithmic discrimination? Or are existing civil rights laws sufficient to address these harms? Readings for this section of class are:
