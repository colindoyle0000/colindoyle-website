To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have posted a reading assignment for a particular day, I will not change the assignment by adding more reading for that day.

Do not forget to submit your reading response the evening before class. Details about your weekly reading responses can be found on the [assignments and grading page][1].

## Lesson 01 - Aug. 22

### The scope and scale of legal algorithms

Our first class will address some foundational questions. 

- Why does this class exist and why are you taking it? 
- How are algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning already affecting legal decision-making? What are the benefits? What concerns does this development raise?



_Assignment:_

Part One: In prior versions of this course, I’ve devoted time on the first day for students to introduce themselves and share what topics they’re interested in learning about in the class. I’d still like to take the time for you to introduce yourselves. But I have an additional assignment I’d like you to do before class. Instead of sharing aloud with the class what you’d like to get out of the class, I’d like you to ask a large language model (such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)) to write your introduction to this class based upon your background and interests. On the first day, each student will share with the rest of the class the personal introduction that the LLM has crafted for them — along with any commentary you may have about the LLM‘s statements. In turn, I will share with the class ChatGPT’s vision of a class entitled “Law, Justice, and Algorithms” and share how our class differs from the AI model’s prediction.

Part Two: Use some of the language from the introduction that the LLM has created for you as a prompt for [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) (or another text-to-image model like StableDiffusion or MidJourney) to create an image.

Please email me both the LLM text and image as part of your reading response. You are welcome to create multiple versions and send me your preferred text and image.

## Lesson 02 - Aug. 29

### An introduction to machine learning
In this class, we will discuss how the field of machine learning has developed, what it looks like now, and how it may look in the future. With a firmer understanding of what machine learning is, we can address the question of whether we need distinct legal or regulatory frameworks for governing algorithmic decision-making systems or whether the “law of the algorithm” is an unnecessarily specific instance of more general principles.

## Lesson 04 - Sep. 12

### Fairness and discrimination
Recent developments in A.I. and machine learning raise questions about how fairness, equality, and nondiscrimination should be understood, defined, assessed, and advanced. As you make your way through this week’s readings, keep the following questions in mind:

- What are the contrasting conceptions of fairness at work in these different sources? 
- How should we reconcile competing concerns of accuracy and equity?
- How should an understanding of historic and systemic inequality influence the approach to incorporating machine learning into legal decision-making?
- Do risk scores pose the same or different problems depending on the decision-making context (e.g., access to credit, eligibility for pretrial release without bail, parole eligibility, policing, child welfare, and so on)?

## Lesson 05 - Sep. 19

### Case study on risk assessments

What was your attitude toward risk assessments before doing these readings? What changed and why?

If you had to align yourself with one of the authors or between multiple authors, who would they be? How would your perspective differ from theirs?

What do you think of the “perfect is the enemy of good” argument from the “Open Letter”? Does your answer depend on a conception of risk assessments as either a positive incremental change or a distraction from other interventions?

What do you make of Mayson’s argument to use risk assessments to predict needs and intervene in positive ways?
Mayson’s article leaves out what to do for pretrial incarceration in the absence of risk assessments. How do you expect that the open letter authors would respond? Would you buy their response? How would you approach the challenge that Mayson leaves unanswered?

## Lesson 06 - Sep. 26

### Transparency, interpretability, and explainability

In this session we will discuss different approaches to achieve explainability, both from a legal and technical perspective. We will learn about the difference between interpretable algorithms and non-interpretable algorithms, and the difference between transparency ex-ante and transparency ex-post including different auditing methods. We will also discuss the tradeoff between transparency and accuracy, and how balance between the two can be achieved. 

Questions to consider:

- Does a requirement of transparency or explanation in the use of algorithms in decision-making promote fairness? 
- How would it work and what would be limitations? 
- How should different legal contexts require different transparency practices?

## Lesson 07 - Oct. 3

### Prediction and probability

Many legal concepts and practices are rooted in the language and logic of prediction and probability. Before issuing a preliminary injunction, a judge must predict whether the plaintiffs will win their case on the merits. Police must have probable cause for many arrests, searches, and seizures to be constitutionally permissible. Child welfare agencies triage investigations of suspected neglect based on predictions of which claims will be substantiated, while public housing authorities manage waitlists for housing based on predictions of who will use public housing for the shortest length of time before living independently. Across legal systems nationwide, algorithmic predictions are replacing or informing predictions traditionally made by humans. Today, algorithms can deny a person government food benefits, send a social worker to investigate a home, or ban a person from flying on commercial airlines.

As you go through this week’s readings, ask yourself about the compatibility of traditional legal concepts and emerging algorithmic systems. How much is a legal idea like “probable cause” governed by our understanding of probability? As we develop or encounter systems that consider probability much more rigorously than judges or police traditionally would, how much should statistical thinking govern our decision-making? Are there some legal concepts that can be reduced to numerical probability and some that should not be understood in purely probabilistic terms? Why? When is it fair to make a legal judgment that depends upon a prediction about someone based on that person’s similarity to a broader group? Is it ever possible to make a prediction about someone that doesn’t rely upon their similarity to a broader group?

## Lesson 08 - Oct. 17

### Generative A.I. & Law

In this class, we’ll explore how A.I. — particularly generative A.I. — may or may not disrupt our contemporary legal systems. As you work through this week’s readings, ask yourself how our legal systems should adapt to a world of generative A.I.. What foundations should remain secure and what foundations are threatened? What are the benefits that may accrue and what are the harms? Who stands to lose and who stands to gain?

### Generative A.I. & the Legal Profession

What are the possible benefits and drawbacks of large language models like GPT-4 for legal education and the legal profession? How can law schools best integrate these technologies into legal education? How can lawyers best integrate these technologies into legal work?

How might the widespread adoption of large language models in the legal profession affect the job market for lawyers and other legal professionals? Will these technologies complement or replace traditional legal roles?

To what extent should large language models be regulated within the legal profession? Can large language models be held accountable for providing incorrect or misleading legal advice? How can we ensure that AI technologies maintain the ethical standards of the legal profession?
