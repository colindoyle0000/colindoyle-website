To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have posted a reading assignment for a particular day, I will not change the assignment by adding more reading for that day.

Do not forget to submit your reading response the evening before class. Details about your weekly reading responses can be found on the [assignments and grading page][1].

## Lesson 01 - Aug. 22

### The scope and scale of legal algorithms

Our first class will address some foundational questions. 

- Why does this class exist and why are you taking it? 
- How are algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning already affecting legal decision-making? What are the benefits? What concerns does this development raise?



_Assignment:_

Part One: In prior versions of this course, I’ve devoted time on the first day for students to introduce themselves and share what topics they’re interested in learning about in the class. I’d still like to take the time for you to introduce yourselves. But I have an additional assignment I’d like you to do before class. Instead of sharing aloud with the class what you’d like to get out of the class, I’d like you to ask a large language model (such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)) to write your introduction to this class based upon your background and interests. On the first day, each student will share with the rest of the class the personal introduction that the LLM has crafted for them — along with any commentary you may have about the LLM‘s statements. In turn, I will share with the class ChatGPT’s vision of a class entitled “Law, Justice, and Algorithms” and share how our class differs from the AI model’s prediction.

Part Two: Use some of the language from the introduction that the LLM has created for you as a prompt for [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) (or another text-to-image model like StableDiffusion or MidJourney) to create an image.

Please email me both the LLM text and image as part of your reading response. You are welcome to create multiple versions and send me your preferred text and image.

## Lesson 02 - Aug. 29

### An introduction to machine learning
In this class, we will discuss how the field of machine learning has developed, what it looks like now, and how it may look in the future. With a firmer understanding of what machine learning is, we can address the question of whether we need distinct legal or regulatory frameworks for governing algorithmic decision-making systems or whether the “law of the algorithm” is an unnecessarily specific instance of more general principles.
