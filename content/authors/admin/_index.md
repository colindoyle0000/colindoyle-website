I'm Colin Doyle, an Associate Professor of Law at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. I use this website to collect, curate, and share my writing and my teaching materials.

My research focuses on law and emerging technology, particularly machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of my work explores how overlooked features of new technology can challenge longstanding beliefs and practices within law. Other research critiques traditional frameworks of authority in automated legal systems, exploring how machine learning could be used to study and surveil the powerful rather than the marginalized.

My scholarship has appeared in the [ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372859), the [Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7639&context=jclc), and the [Duke Law Journal Online](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&context=dlj_online). My research has been cited in federal and state court decisions, including the California Supreme Court’s landmark decision, [_In re Humphrey_](https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S247278.PDF), that found the state’s money bail practices to be unconstitutional. I also write for a broader public audience with work appearing in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/opinion/pretrial-ai.html), [The Appeal](https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/chesa-boudin-cash-bail-predictions/), and the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/03/25/ny-legislators-should-focus-on-reducing-pretrial-incarceration/?slreturn=20200511122017).

At Loyola Law School, I teach torts to first-year law students. I also teach two upper-level courses: a seminar called "Law, Algorithms, and Justice" and a doctrinal course on state constitutional law.

Before becoming a law professor, I was a Climenko Fellow at Harvard Law School and worked as a staff attorney at the Criminal Justice Policy Program at Harvard Law School. I received my J.D. _magna cum laude_ from Harvard Law School, where I served as Articles Chair for the Harvard Law Review.
