## Welcome!
This course explores the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence and its impact on law and legal practice. Students will learn how generative AI works, how generative AI is being adopted within the legal profession, and the insights offered by leading research into its potential, challenges, and risks.

The course integrates lectures, seminar-style discussions, and hands-on laboratory sessions. Lectures will provide the technical and conceptual groundwork for understanding how generative AI works, its potential impact on legal work, and its capacity to address systemic issues like access to justice. In seminar discussions, students will analyze cutting-edge research and debate generative AI's ethical, practical, and doctrinal implications. In hands-on laboratory sessions, students will experiment with using generative AI tools for legal work. These exercises will teach students both how AI can improve their writing, research, and problem-solving skills and also how AI can undermine the effectiveness of their advocacy and critical thinking.

By the end of the course, students will have acquired the skills necessary to critically assess and responsibly engage with generative AI.

To take this class, there is no requirement for any level of technical expertise.
