## Overview

This course is worth two credits. According to ABA Standard 310, for a two-credit course you are expected to spend at least four hours per week on course-related work outside of class. 

Your grade will be based on:

- Short exercises (in-class and homework) (25%)
- Class participation (25%)
- Final paper and presentation (50%)

## Short Exercises
Throughout the semester, there will be a series of short exercises designed to help you engage with the course material. These exercises will take various forms, including in-class activities, written homework assignments, and practical and experimental applications of the tools and methods that we discuss in class.

## Class Participation
Class preparation is required. I expect that you will come to class having completed the reading and ready to speak about the materials assigned for that day. You are expected to participate actively in class discussions every week.

I also expect you to ask questions of each other in class, and you should always feel free to ask me questions as well. In particular, I would encourage you to ask about anything unclear from the readings. Please don’t be embarrassed to ask about things you don’t understand — there will likely be others with the same question.

## Final Paper & Presentation
Final projects should be conducted in teams of 1-3 students. You are allowed to work in pairs or teams but may also choose to work independently. You must complete a research paper (approximately 10 single-spaced pages) and related presentation (approximately 15-20 minutes) that is inspired by the course material. These projects are an opportunity for you to examine a wider range of techniques, domains, and moral and legal principles than we have covered in class.

Although you have flexibility in constructing these projects, I anticipate that most projects will take one of two forms:

1) Describe the use or potential use of generative AI in a part of our legal system and analyze the positive and negative implications of this development using the principles and theories explored in class.

2) Analyze how current law and policy should adapt to respond to generative AI.

3) Conduct an original experiment using generative AI tools or propose a set of research questions and methods for future empirical research into generative AI and law.

Students are encouraged to discuss ideas for final projects in class. Later in the semester, we will carve out time in class for students to discuss potential projects and recruit partners and teammates.

To help formulate your final project, students are _highly_ encouraged to schedule office hours with me before the end of March.

Student presentations will be held on our final three weeks of class. You are encouraged to use the questions and reactions to your in-class presentations to refine your final paper.

Final papers are due on Friday, May 8, 2026 and should be submitted to me via email.
