To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have posted a reading assignment for a particular day, I will not change the assignment by adding more reading for that day.

I _highly_ encourage you to take notes as you read. Reading without taking notes is not reading at all. Jotting down notes only after finishing the assigned reading will almost always result in a subpar reading response. As you work through your reading assignments, don’t read passively and don’t take anything for granted. As you read, write down questions that come to mind. Ask yourself: What aspects of the author’s argument do you agree and disagree with? Why? Why not? What are the opportunities and limitations of these ideas? What assumptions are being taken for granted? What questions have been left unasked? What questions would you like to ask the author?

### Generative AI, the legal profession, and law school

Our first class will address some foundational questions: 

- Why does this class exist and why are you taking it? 
- How have you been thinking about generative AI up to this point? What impact do you think generative AI will have on your future?
- How should the legal profession respond to generative AI? How should law schools and law students respond to generative AI? What are the risks? What are the benefits? What would responsible engagement with generative AI even look like?
- To be able answer these prior questions, what do we need to know first? How would we go about acquiring that knowledge?

_Assignment:_

Part One: I’d like to devote time on the first day for students to introduce themselves. But there’s a catch: You are not allowed to introduce yourselves in your own words. Instead, you should use generative AI to create an introduction for you. The introduction can be text, an image, video, audio, or a combination of these formats. The introduction should address your background, why you are interested in this class, and your learning goals for the class. 

If your introduction includes images, video, or audio, please email me a copy or a link to the material before 9am on Jan. 14 so that I can include the material within our class slides.

As an LMU student, you have access to Microsoft Copilot, available [here](https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/computingsoftware/microsoft/microsoftcopilot/), but you are free to use any generative AI tools that you would like to create your introduction. Feel free to experiment with different tools and approaches. Although the introduction should be composed of material generated by AI, you should feel free to cut up, edit, and recombine the material as you see fit.

## Jan. 21, 2026

This week, we will continue our discussion of generative AI and the legal profession, starting close to home with law school by finishing our drafts and discussion of generative AI policies for law school classes.

The assignments for the groups assigned at the end of last class are:

Groups 1, 3: Draft a generative AI policy for this class

Groups 2, 4: Draft a default generative AI policy for seminar classes

Group 5: Draft a default generative AI policy for doctrinal classes

To prepare for class on Wednesday, students should take notes that address the following questions:

- What problems arise, if any, from a policy that allows unrestricted use of generative AI?
- What problems arise, if any, from a policy that bans all use of generative AI?
- How might these problems be mitigated through policy design?
- To design a better policy, what information, skills, or resources would be helpful?

At the start of class, each group will have 15 minutes to share notes with one another and create a draft policy. Each group will then present their draft policy to the class, along with their answers to the questions above.

Each of the first few weeks of class will also include some time dedicated to learning about how machine learning and generative AI tools are built and function under the hood.

The rest of the class will be devoted to a broader discussion of generative AI rules and policies for the legal profession. Included in the readings below are websites that have collected examples of lawyers filing court documents that included AI-generated hallucinations, as well as examples of courts issuing standing orders and local rules regarding the use of AI by lawyers. For class, you're not expected to read through all of the examples on these websites. Instead, try to skim through a random selection of examples to get a sense of the types of issues that have arisen so far. Take notes on what stands out to you, what questions you have, what patterns you notice, and what additional information you would like to learn. Our discussion will start with students being randomly called on to share their notes and observations so that we can collectively get a better sense of the landscape of the issues and responses that have arisen so far.

I'm a little sheepish about assigning my own work as reading, but this passage is just a succinct, accessible introduction to how LLMs work and their limitations for legal reasoning. Anything I assign in class that I've written should be open to challenge and critique as much as anyone else's work. I imagine (or at least hope) that I am my own worst critic.

In class this week, we will start by continuing our discussion from last week regarding generative AI policies for the law schools and the legal profession. Then, we will take a moment to understand the fundamentals of what machine learing is and how machine learning models are trained. Finally, we will turn to the topic of experimental design and how to design experiments to test hypotheses about AI and law. It's an information-dense week, but it will provide a foundation that will enrich our discussions in the weeks to come.

This week, we will continue our discussion of experimental design and how to design experiments to test hypotheses about AI and law. The readings for this week are light because your main assignment is to design a small, informal experiment to test a hypothesis about generative AI and the law.

_Readings:_

To inspire you to do great work:
[Richard Hamming, *You and Your Research* (1986)](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf)

To give you a sense of structure for experimental design and reporting (along with citations to related literature that you might find useful):
[Matthew Dahl, *Bye-bye, Bluebook? Automating Legal Procedure with Large Language Models* (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02763)

_Assignment:_

**Informal Experiment Design**

Due on Tuesday, February 3 by midnight, the night before class via email. Please attach your experiment design notes as a Word document or PDF.

Your assignment is to design a small, informal experiment about language models and law. Think of it as a prototype for a publishable study idea: you’re kicking the tires on a research question and testing out ideas for experimental design. In class on Wednesday, we will workshop some of your experiment designs together and conduct at least one of the experiments live as a class.

Your design document should include the following:
Title (give your experiment a name)
Research question
Hypothesis
Experimental design
Limitations and Future Directions

Some notes:

**Research Question:** Select a research question that genuinely interests you. What is a question about generative AI and the law that you want answered? What do you wonder about? Do not use generative AI to come up with your research question as it should be something that *you* care about.

**Hypothesis:** Your hypothesis should be a clear, testable statement that predicts an outcome.

**Experiment Design:** Describe how you will test your hypothesis, including the language models you will use and the interactions you will have with them. 

You may use generative AI to help you think through experimental design. This is a new kind of task for most people. Language models can be useful for pointing out blind spots, suggesting controls, or helping you see alternative designs you hadn’t considered. But engage critically with any suggestions the model makes. You are responsible for the final design of your experiment. You should not include any experimental design or analysis choice that you cannot fully explain and defend.

**Limitations and Future Directions** This is really important! Your experiment won’t be able to fully answer your research question. What are the limitations of your design? What might complicate your findings? How might your results *not* provide a full explanation of the question you’re trying to ask? How could future work build on your experiment to provide a more complete answer to your research question?
