To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have posted a reading assignment for a particular day, I will not change the assignment by adding more reading for that day.

I _highly_ encourage you to take notes as you read. Reading without taking notes is not reading at all. Jotting down notes only after finishing the assigned reading will almost always result in a subpar reading response. As you work through your reading assignments, don’t read passively and don’t take anything for granted. As you read, write down questions that come to mind. Ask yourself: What aspects of the author’s argument do you agree and disagree with? Why? Why not? What are the opportunities and limitations of these ideas? What assumptions are being taken for granted? What questions have been left unasked? What questions would you like to ask the author?

### Generative AI, the legal profession, and law school.

Our first class will address some foundational questions. 

- Why does this class exist and why are you taking it? How have you been thinking about generative AI up to this point? What impact do you think generative AI will have on your future?
- How should the legal profession respond to generative AI?How should law schools and law students respond to generative AI? What are the risks? What are the benefits? What would responsible engagement with generative AI even look like?
- To be able answer these prior questions, what do we need to know first? How would we go about acquiring that knowledge?

_Assignment:_

Part One: I’d like to devote time on the first day for students to introduce themselves. But there’s a catch: You are not allowed to introduce yourselves in your own words. Instead, you should use generative AI to create an introduction for you. The introduction can be text, an image, video, audio, or a combination of these formats. The introduction should address your background, why you are interested in this class, and your learning goals for the class. 

If your introduction includes images, video, or audio, please email me a copy or a link to material before 9am on Jan. 11 so that I can include the material within our class slides.

As an LMU student, you have access to Microsoft Copilot, available [here](https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/computingsoftware/microsoft/microsoftcopilot/), but you are free to use any generative AI tools that you would like to create your introduction. Feel free to experiment with different tools and approaches. Although the introduction should be composed of material generated by AI, you should feel free to cut up, edit, and recombine the material as you see fit.
