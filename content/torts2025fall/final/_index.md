The final exam will count for 75% of your grade.

Your exam packet will include two appendices. Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendices while you take the exam.

A copy of the [exam instructions](/../../torts2025fall-material/final/torts_final_instructions.pdf) and a copy of the [appendices](/../../torts2025fall-material/final/torts_final_appendices.pdf) are available for you to use as you study. These are identical to the instructions and appendices you will receive in your exam packet when you take the exam.
