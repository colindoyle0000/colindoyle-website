The 2024 final exam memo is available [here](/../../torts2025-material/past-exam/final-memo2024.pdf). 

The memos include my commentary on the questions along with strong student answers.

I would encourage you to use the questions on the exam as practice problems as you prepare for the final. Keep in mind that previous years' classes did not cover exactly the same cases and material.
