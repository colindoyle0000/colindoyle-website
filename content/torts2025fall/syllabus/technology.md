## Class Recordings
The Instructional Technology Department will post video recordings of class on [brightspace](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/280846/Home) as soon as the video files have been received and processed.

Separate from the Instructional Technology Department, I maintain audio recordings and AI-generated transcripts of the class that are available [here](https://otter.ai/group/26334606). The link will only work for people whom I have invited to join the group “Torts Fall 2025.” Following our first class, you should receive an invite link. You will also need to created an account with the hosting platform, Otter.ai. If you are unable to access the audio recordings and transcripts, please [email me](mailto:Colin.Doyle@lls.edu).

You will find that the Otter.ai platform allows you to correct the transcripts, make highlights, and add comments. You should know that these changes will be visible to the entire class. I encourage you to use the transcript as a collaborative document. You should feel free to make corrections to the transcript and to highlight material you find important or useful. 

Please note that you are not allowed to record or share all or a portion of classes at Loyola Law School (video, audio, or photo) without the express permission of your instructor or the law school administration.

## Slides
I will post a copy of my [slides](/torts2025fall/course-content/slides) to this website after each class.

## Course Website
You're on the [course website](http://www.colin-doyle.net/torts2025fall/) right now. I may also use our course [Brightspace page](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/280846/Home) to make announcements and to host content that cannot be shared publicly.
