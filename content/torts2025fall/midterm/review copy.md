The midterm review memo is available [here](/../../torts2023-material/midterm/midterm_memo_2023_fall.pdf). You can retrieve a copy of your exam answers [here](https://onlineforms.lls.edu/form/torts-exam-return-doyle).

Once you have reviewed your exam, I am more than happy to meet with you individually or in groups to go over your exams. If you finish your review of this exam and still have questions about how to approach an exam for this class, this is great timing for meeting with me one-on-one so that I can understand your approach and coach you for the final.

Before booking a meeting please confirm that you have done the following:

- You have read the midterm review memo in its entirety.
- You have identified the issues that you missed on the exam.
- You have taken notes on how you would rewrite your exam answers if you had the opportunity.
- You understand that, under Loyola Law School policy, your grade cannot be changed unless there was a clerical error in calculating your score.
- You understand that if you would like to go over your midterm exam answers with me, you will need to give me a redacted version of your exam answers and grading sheet that do not include your Student ID number.

You can book a one-on-one appointment using [this link](https://fantastical.app/colindoyle0000-CZrJ/midterm-review). Once you have reserved a timeslot, those times will no longer be available for other students. So please reserve only one timeslot and make sure that it is at a time that you can attend.
 
Meetings will be held in my office, Burns 315. If you would prefer to meet over zoom, please write that in the “optional comment” field when you request your timeslot. 

Some notes on redacting exams:

I do not know whose exams are whose. I do not want to know your Student ID number before grading the final exam. If you would like to go over your midterm exam answers with me, you will need to give me a redacted version of your exam answers and grading sheet that do not include your Student ID number. 

PDF software like “Preview” on Mac computers includes redaction tools. Before emailing me a copy of your exam answers, please redact your ID information on each page so that I won’t learn what your ID number is. If you don’t feel like messing around with PDF software, you’re also welcome to bring to the meeting a printed paper copy of your answers with your Student ID information scribbled out.
 
Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any issues signing up for a meeting. I highly recommend that you come to our meeting with specific questions in mind. It is up to you to set the agenda and to choose what we talk about. The more targeted your questions, the better I’m able to help.
