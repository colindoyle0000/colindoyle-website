The midterm exam will count for 25% of your grade, and the final exam will count for 75%.  The midterm is purposefully weighted less than the final exam to give you the opportunity to improve your work in this class over time.

The midterm will include two appendices. Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendix while you take the exam.

I will share a copy of both appendices on the course website before the exam so that you can familiarize yourself with the material before taking the exam.
