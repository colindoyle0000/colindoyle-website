The midterm exam has three parts and two appendices. Each of the three parts consists of a fact pattern and an essay question. The three parts are equally weighted at one-third of your total grade.

Your exam packet will include two appendices. Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendix while you take the exam. 

A copy of the [exam instructions](/../../torts2025-material/midterm/midterm_instructions.pdf) and a copy of the [appendices](/../../torts2025-material/midterm/midterm_appendices.pdf) are available for you to use as you study. These are identical to the instructions and appendices you will receive in your exam packet when you take the exam.

Included below are links to PDF versions of the instructions and appendices you will receive when you take the exam. I am providing them here so that you can familiarize yourself with the material before taking the exam.

Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. When you take the midterm exam, you will receive a copy of these appendices as part of your exam packet. You are allowed to consult those appendices while you take your exam.


This list includes cases discussed in-depth during class. It is not an exhaustive list of all cases. You are welcome and encouraged to reference cases discussed in the casebook that are not included in this list. You will not receive credit for referencing cases that were neither discussed in class nor included in the casebook. The cases are listed chronologically in the order that we discussed them in class.
