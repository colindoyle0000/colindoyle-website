I spent most of my first semester of law school in a state of total confusion. On a day-to-day basis, I was holding it together. I kept up with the readings, took careful notes, and was prepared for cold calls. Although I was able to make sense of each class and case individually, I had no clue how the different cases, legal rules, commentary, and history all fit together. It wasn't until the end of the course — when I wrote an outline to study for the exam — that I began to see how the different pieces fit together.

I've created this roadmap as a way for you to understand how parts of the course fit together in a big-picture way even as we take a case-by-case approach to individual lessons.
