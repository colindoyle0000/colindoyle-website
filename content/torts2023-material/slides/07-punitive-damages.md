### Oral argument: Appealing a Punitive Damages Award

When we reconvene for class on Tuesday, we we will moot oral arguments for a case on appeal before the Loyola Supreme Court: _Hershovitz v. Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies_

Odd-numbered groups (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) are attorneys for the plaintiff.
Even-numbered groups (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) are attorneys for the defendant.

On Tuesday, I will cold call students at random to present their arguments. I will ask follow-up questions, and I will call on students representing the opposing side to address the points that have been made.

The only legal issue on appeal in this case is whether the punitive damages award in this case is excessive and would deprive the defendant of its property without due process of law.

**Use** the legal tests we just went over in class.
**Draw** upon and **analogize to** the reasoning from these cases.
