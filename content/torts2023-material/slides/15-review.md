1. ??????????
2. ??????????
3. ??????????
4. ??????????

# Negligence as a Cause of Action

Plaintiff must prove four elements:

1. Duty
2. Breach
3. Causation
4. Harm

---

## Prima facie case of negligence

On its face, plaintiff has met the burden of proving duty, breach, causation, and harm.

Doesn’t mean plaintiff wins! Just means that a jury *could* find for the plaintiff.

# Negligence as a Concept

Relates to the elements of duty and breach

The “fault” principle

Defined as a failure to exercise “reasonable care”

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- ??????????
\- ??????????
\- ??????????
\- ??????????
\- ??????????

**Special Considerations**
\- ??????????

---

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability
\- The Reasonable Person
\- Custom
\- Statute
\- Cost-Benefit Analysis (Hand Formula: B < P\*L)

**Special Considerations**
\- Judge and jury relationship

---

# Foreseeability

Foreseeability is a flexible concept.

Define any event in general enough terms and it is foreseeable.

Define any event in narrow enough terms and it is unforeseeable.

---

# Reasonable Person Standard

An objective standard designed to clarify what reasonable care requires.

**Exceptions to objective standard**:
\- Physical disability
\- Children
\- Expertise

**Not exceptions to objective standard**
\- Mental disability
\- Children engaged in adult activity
\- Old age & infirmity

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

---

## Economic theory of negligence

**Hand Formula**

B = Burden of precautionary measures
P = Probability of loss/harm
L = Magnitude of loss/harm

IF B < PL 
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was negligent

IF B > PL
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was NOT negligent

---

## BPL Example

Railroad company with a 50% chance of causing $200k in damage to a farm beside the railroad tracks. Solar panels are available as a possible precaution. Would reduce 100% of the harm to the plaintiff at cost of $200k to railroad company. Railroad company takes no precautions. Was the railroad company negligent?

B = $200k
P = 50%
L = $200k

B > P * L
$200k > (50% * $200k)

---

## BPL Example

Same facts as before. Railroad company with a 50% chance of causing $200k in damage to a farm beside the railroad tracks. But now spark arresters are also available as a possible precaution. Would reduce likelihood of the harm to plaintiff by 50% at cost of $30k to railroad company. Railroad company takes no precautions. Was the railroad company negligent?

B = $30k
P = 25%
L = $200k

B < P * L
$30k < (25% * $200k)

---

## BPL Example

| Possible precautions | Cost for defendant | Expected cost for plaintiff | Total cost to society |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No Precaution        | $0                 | $100k                       | $100k                 |
| Solar Panels         | $200k              | $0                          | $200k                 |
| Spark Arresters      | $30k               | $50k                        | $80k                  |

## Economic Theory of Negligence

- Fault = economic inefficiency

- Embodies a trust in private ordering and economic incentives

- Driven by a goal of maximizing overall economic welfare

## Critiques of Economic Theory

- Incommeasurability of harms

- Uncertainty of cost calculations

---

## That’s all, folks!

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability
\- The Reasonable Person
\- Custom
\- Statute
\- Cost-Benefit Analysis (Hand Formula: B < P\*L)

**Special Considerations**
\- Judge and jury relationship

# Noriega v. Loyola State Fair

Assignment: Deliver a memo detailing potential theories of negligence that could be argued in this case. For each argument, you should include:

- what constituted reasonable care under the circumstances, and why, and how the defendant failed to exercise that duty of reasonable care

- what the defense’s best counterarguments would be

- in your estimation, how strong of a theory of negligence this is
