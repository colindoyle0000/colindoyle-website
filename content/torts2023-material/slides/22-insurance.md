# Insurance-related rules in tort suits

- Collateral source rule
- Subrogation

---

## Understanding these rules in combination

A defendant injures a plaintiff. The plaintiff’s health insurance provider covers most of the plaintiff’s medical bills. The plaintiff wins a lawsuit against the defendant. Consider the process and outcomes for this case under three different legal regimes. What potential problems arise?

1. Only the collateral source rule exists — no subrogation

2. Only subrogation exists — no collateral source rule

3. Both the collateral source rule and subrogation exist (our actual legal regime)

# Straightforward example: a house fire

# But it gets complicated with:

- Personal injury
- Settlement

---

# Liability Insurance

---

# How does liability insurance affect tort law?

1. Changes how damages are paid.
2. Changes what lawsuits are filed.
3. Can affect substantive tort law itself.
4. Can affect policy rationale / justification for legal rules.

# Remember the Rowland Factors?

- foreseeability of harm
- certainty of plaintiff’s injury
- connection between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury
- moral blame
- policy of preventing harm
- burden to defendant
- consequences to community
- **availability of liability insurance**
