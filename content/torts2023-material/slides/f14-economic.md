# Exercise

You are a Supreme Court Justice in the State of Loyola Supreme Court, hearing a case on appeal. Your small group represents the entire Loyola Supreme Court. 

How do you rule? You are welcome to have majority opinions, concurring opinons, and dissenting opinions.

# Proving Negligence

To establish that conduct fell below standard of reasonable care, plaintiff needs to prove:

1. What defendant did or did not do.
2. What defendant should have done.

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

---

# United States v. Carroll Towing Co.

A workable formula for reasonable care?

---

# BPL

B = Burden of precautionary measures
P = Probability of loss/harm
L = Magnitude of loss/harm

IF B < PL 
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was negligent

IF B > PL
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was NOT negligent

## BPL Example

Railroad company with a 50% chance of causing $200k in damage to a farm beside the railroad tracks. (P * L = $100k). Solar panels are available as a possible precaution. Would reduce 100% of the harm to the plaintiff at cost of $200k to railroad company. Railroad company takes no precautions. Was the railroad company negligent?

| Possible Precautions for Defendant to Take | Cost of precautionary measure | Expected cost to plaintiff | Total cost to society |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No Precaution                              | $0                            | $100k                      | $100k                 |
| Solar Panels                               | $200k                         | $0                         | $200k                 |

# BPL Example

Same facts as before. But now spark arresters are also available as a possible precaution. Would reduce 50% of the harm to plaintiff at cost of $30k to railroad company. Railroad company takes no precautions. Was the railroad company negligent?

| Possible Precautions for Defendant to Take | Cost of precautionary measure | Expected cost to plaintiff | Total cost to society |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No Precaution                              | $0                            | $100k                      | $100k                 |
| Solar Panels                               | $200k                         | $0                         | $200k                 |
| Spark Arresters                            | $30k                          | $50k                       | $80k                  |

- Fault = economic inefficiency

- Embodies a trust in private ordering and economic incentives

- Driven by a goal of maximizing overall economic welfare

## Critiques of Economic Theory

- Incommeasurability of harms

- Uncertainty of cost calculations

## What we’ve learned…

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability
\- The Reasonable Person
\- Custom
\- Statute
\- Cost-Benefit Analysis (Hand Formula: B < P\*L)

**Special Considerations**
\- Judge and jury relationship
