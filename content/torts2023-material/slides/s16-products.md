## “Reasonable Alternative Design” Challenges

![](images/vw.jpg)

![](images/newport.jpeg)

You are the lawyer for the plaintiff in a case where the plaintiff has smoked cigarettes since she was 16 years old. She's now in her 50s and she has terminal lung cancer, and she is suing the cigarette manufacturers for products liability under a design-defect theory. What do you propose as a reasonable alternative design?

Should the plaintiff succeed on this theory? Should the plaintiff succeed on the merits of the case but for different reasons? Should the plaintiff not prevail at all?

# Plaintiff’s failure to discover a defect

**Restatement (Second) of Torts**

Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense when such negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect in the product, or to guard against the possibility of its existence.

**Restatement Third**

[W]hen the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to discover a defect, there must be evidence that the plaintiff’s conduct in failing to discover a defect did, in fact, fail to meet a standard of reasonable care. In general, a plaintiff has no reason to expect that a new product contains a defect and would have little reason to be on guard to discover it.
