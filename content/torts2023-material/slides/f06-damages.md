# Systemic Inequality & Damages Calculations

Consideration of race, gender, national origin, and immigration status.

# Argument in favor

Accuracy

Compensatory damages are about what is, not what should be

---

# Critiques

Creates harmful incentives for potential tortfeasors

Assumes the future = the past

Ignores expressive function of law

# My own take

Accuracy argument weaker than it appears

- What is individual accuracy?
- Statistical modeling always involves normative choices

Elimination of explicit consideration of race and gender does not eliminate influence of systemic inequality on damages awards:

- Proxies persist

- Compensatory damages in an unequal society restores inequality
