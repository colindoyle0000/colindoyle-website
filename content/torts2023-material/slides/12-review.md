---

# Today’s Agenda

1. Review of Defenses
2. In-Class Exercise

—

**Negligence**
~~Elements of a cause of action:~~
~~--- Duty~~
~~--- Breach~~
~~--- Causation~~
~~--- Harm~~
Defenses:
--- Contributory or Comparative Negligence
--- Assumption of Risk

---

# The kinds of questions you can now answer
(given the right information about jurisdictional rules and case-specific facts)

\- Does the defense of contributory negligence apply?
\- Was the plaintiff comparatively negligent?
\- Does the defense of “assumption of risk” apply?
\- How much can the plaintiff recover?
\- How much does each defendant owe?
\- If a particular defendant is absent or insolvent, how much do the other defendants owe?

# Contributory Negligence in General:

**The defendant is not liable**
**If** the plaintiff was also negligent 
--- Duty,
--- Breach,
--- Causation, and
--- Harm
**Unless** an exception applies:
--- Last clear chance,
--- Recklessness or willfulness of defendant, or
--- Statute

# Comparative Negligence

Three forms:
1. Pure comparative negligence
2. “Not as great as”
3. “No greater than”

---

# How much does each defendant pay?

**Common Law Approach**

Divide up damages by number of liable defendants

Doctrine of contribution:
1. Joint and several liability, or
2. Several liability

---

# How much does each defendant pay?

**Modern Approach**

Divide up damages based on comparative fault

Doctrine of contribution:
Variety of rules across jurisdictions, including several liability, joint-and-several liability, and a variety of hybrids.

---

# [fit] Don’t 
# [fit] forget about 
# [fit] factual cause!

---

# Order of operations for allocating damages with multiple injuries and multiple defendants

**First step:**
Separate injuries based on factual cause.

**Second step:**
For injuries that multiple defendants caused, sort out who owes what based on jurisdictional rules.


---

# Assumption of Risk

\- Explicit / Express
\- Implicit / Implied

---

# Two Common Issues with Explicit Assumption of Risk

1. Was the contract clear enough about releasing the defendant from liability?
2. Will the court enforce contract?

---

# Will the court enforce contract?

Various legal tests for determining if liability waiver is against public policy:

\- Liability waivers are unenforceable
\- Totality of the circumstances
\- Six factors from _Tunkl_


---

# Implicit assumption of risk

_volenti non fit injuria_

“to one who is willing, no wrong is done”

---

# Should assumption of risk persist in a comparative fault world?

---

## For exam questions, how do we know whether to look to assumption of risk or contributory negligence or comparative negligence?

—

# In-Class Exercise

# Tunkl factors

1. Business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.
2. Defendant performs a service of great importance to the public (often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public)
3. Defendant willing to perform this service for any member of the public
4. Defendant has bargaining advantage
5. Standardized adhesion contract of exculpation
6. Plaintiff placed under the control of the defendant, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.
