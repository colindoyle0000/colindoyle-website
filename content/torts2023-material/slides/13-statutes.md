1. What defendant did or did not do.

2. What defendant should have done.

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

“Leaving Keys in the Ignition”

In recommending the enactment of section 1210, the Joint Legislative Committee on Motor Vehicle Problems stated that the proposed law was: 

“designed to obviate the risk of a vehicle moving from the place where it was left parked and possibly injuring the person and property of others as well as itself being damaged. It serves to lessen the likelihood of theft”

You are a Supreme Court Justice in the State of Loyola Supreme Court, hearing a case on appeal. Your small group represents the entire Loyola Supreme Court. 

Bowlmoreandup is a three-story bowling alley. At the time of the accident that prompted this litigation, Bowlmoreandup was under renovation. As part of the construction project, there was an open shaft in the center of the building for work crews to ferry supplies and debris throughout the building. A bowling ball placed a foot from the edge of the top of the shaft on the third floor fell into the shaft and landed on the building’s owner, Anita May, causing serious physical injuries. 

May sued two sets of contractors and the construction company, Wrecking Crew Co., for negligence. She claim that the first set of contractors negligently pushed the bowling ball causing it to roll into the open shaft, that the second set of contractors negligently placed the bowling ball too close to the open shaft, and that Wrecking Crew Co. negligently failed to fence around the shaft as required by law. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, finding all of the defendants negligent. The Loyola Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s ruling.

The only issue on appeal to this court is whether the trial court correctly found that one the defendants, Wrecking Crew Co., was negligent as matter of law for violating a statute. The possibility of Anita May’s negligence in standing beneath an open shaft of a construction site is not an issue on this appeal.

Section 241, subdivision 5, of the Loyola Labor Law (as it stood at the time of the accident) contained the following provisions: “If elevators, elevating machines or hod-hoisting apparatus are used within a building in the course of construction, for the purpose of lifting materials to be used, the shafts or openings in each floor shall be inclosed or fenced in on all sides by a barrier of suitable height, except on two sides which may be used for taking off and putting on materials, and those sides shall be guarded by an adjustable barrier not less than three nor more than four feet from the floor and not less than two feet from the edges of such shafts or openings.”

The undisputed facts are that the openings in each floor were protected by a fence consisting of four vertical metal rods of four feet in height and three horizontal plastic rings wrapped around the plastic rods and placed one foot apart starting one foot from the ground. From the trial court proceedings, it is unclear whether the rings were actual hula hoops purchased from a children’s toy store or whether the rings only resembled hula hoops.

In contesting the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, Wrecking Crew Co. argued that the legislative history of Section 241 belies the plaintiff’s claim. In recommending the enactment of Section 241, the Joint Legislative Committee on Labor Safety stated that the proposed law “should be called ‘Doyle’s Law’ and receive universal approval from the legislature following the unfortunate incident in which a law professor wandering around a construction site fell into an unprotected floor opening and was seriously injured.”
