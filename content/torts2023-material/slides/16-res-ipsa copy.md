# Structuring Arguments

## Syllogism for proving duty and breach

D was legally obligated to do X.

D failed to do X.

Therefore, D breached their legal duty.

---

## Detailed version

D had a duty (to the plaintiff) to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

Reasonable care under the circumstances was X, because of
\- foreseeability,
\- reasonable person standard,
\- custom,
\- statute,
\- or hand formula.

D failed to do X, therefore D acted negligently / breached their legal duty to plaintiff.
