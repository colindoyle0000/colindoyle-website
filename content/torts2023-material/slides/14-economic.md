# Proving Negligence

To establish that conduct fell below standard of reasonable care, plaintiff needs to prove:

1. What defendant did or did not do.
2. What defendant should have done.

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

# United States v. Carroll Towing Co.

A workable formula for reasonable care?

---

**B < PL = Negligent**
**B > PL = Not Negligent**

B = Burden of precautionary measures
P = Probability of loss/harm
L = Magnitude of loss/harm

---

# Hand Formula Critiques:

1. Incommeasurability
2. Uncertainty of Quantification

# BPL Example

| Precaution      | B         | P * L | Total Cost |
| --------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------- |
| None            | $0 (or âˆž) | $100k | $100k      |
| Solar Panels    | $200k     | $0k   | $200k      |
| Spark Arresters | $30k      | $50k  | $80k       |

Scenario 1: No precautions available to defendant
Scenario 2: Only solar panels available
Scenario 3: Both solar panels and spark arresters available

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability
\- The Reasonable Person
\- Custom
\- Statute
\- Cost-Benefit Analysis (Hand Formula: B < P\*L)

**Special Considerations**
\- Judge and jury relationship
