Office hours today at 12pm.

# The Exam Itself

—

# Goals for outlining

Creating and studying an outline should help you to:

1. Spot issues on the exam
2. Resolve issues methodically and comprehensively

---

# Damages

---

# [fit] Compensatory

# [fit] Damages

### and punitive damages

---

# Compensatory Damages


**The Objective:**
To restore the plaintiff to the state they were in before the harm caused by the defendant.

---

# Two separate legal inquiries:

1. Liability
2. Damages

---

# Punitive Damages

**BMW v. Gore Guideposts**
1. Degree of reprehensibility
2. Ratio of punitive damages to harm inflicted on plaintiff
3. Comparison with civil or criminal penalties 

**State Farm**
Excess of single digit ratio is presumptively unconstitutional

---

# Negligence

---

# Negligence as a Cause of Action

Plaintiff must prove four elements:

1. Duty
2. Breach
3. Causation
4. Harm

---

# Negligence as a Concept

Relates to the elements of duty and breach

The “fault” principle

Defined as a failure to exercise “reasonable care”

—

## How does a plaintiff normally prove duty and breach?

D was legally obligated to do X.

D failed to do X.

Therefore, D breached their legal duty.

—
## Detailed version

D had a duty (to the plaintiff) to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

Reasonable care under the circumstances was X, because of
\- foreseeability,
\- reasonable person standard,
\- custom,
\- statute,
\- or hand formula.

D failed to do X, therefore D acted negligently / breached their legal duty to plaintiff.

---

# Reasonable Person Standard

Objective standard

**Exceptions to objective standard**:
\- Physical disability
\- Children
\- Expertise

**Not exceptions to objective standard**
\- Mental disability
\- Children engaged in adult activity
\- Old age & infirmity


—
# Foreseeability

Foreseeability is a flexible concept.

Define any event in general enough terms and it is foreseeable.

Define any event in narrow enough terms and it is unforeseeable.

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

---

# Hand Formula (BPL)

B = Burden of precautionary measures
P = Probability of loss/harm
L = Magnitude of loss/harm

IF B < PL 
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was negligent

IF B > PL
AND defendant did not take on B
THEN defendant was NOT negligent

---

# Res ipsa requirements:

1. Harm results from the kind of situation in which negligence can be inferred
2. Defendant was responsible for the instrument of harm

# [fit] The modern rule for non-negligent creation of injury

**Maldonado v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co. (Ariz. App. 1981)**

Issue: Whether the railroad owed the plaintiff a duty to render aid after he was seriously injured by the train.

Court adopts rule from Restatement (Second) of Torts : 

If the actor knows or has reason to know that by his conduct, whether tortious or innocent, he has caused such bodily harm to another as to make him helpless and in danger of further harm, the actor is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such further harm.

Rule varies across jurisdictions. Examples we looked at include:

“Impact” Rule

Bystander Liability
(1) the death or serious physical injury of another caused by defendant’s negligence;
(2) a marital or intimate, familial relationship between plaintiff and the injured person;
(3) observation of the death or injury at the scene of the accident; and 
(4) resulting severe emotional distress

Special Circumstances (like corpse mishandling)
