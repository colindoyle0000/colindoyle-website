# [fit] Hanks v. Powder Ridge Restaurant Corp.

“Snowtubing Waiver”

---

# Two Common Issues

1. Was the contract clear enough about releasing the defendant from liability?
2. Will the court enforce contract?

---

- I fully assume all risks associated with [s]nowtubing, even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants]
- I ... agree I will defend, indemnify and hold harmless [the defendants] ... from any and all claims, suits or demands ... including claims of NEGLIGENCE on the part of [the defendants]
- I will not sue [the defendants] ... for money damages for personal injury ... even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants]

# Will the court enforce contract?

Various legal tests for determining if liability waiver is against public policy:

\- Liability waivers are unenforceable
