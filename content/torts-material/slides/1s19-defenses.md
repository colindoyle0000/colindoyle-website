# Eggshell Plaintiff

If the defendant commits a tort, the defendant takes the victim as he finds him. The defendant must pay damages for the plaintiff's actual injuries, even if those injuries were unforeseeable or uncommon.

**WARNING:**

The plaintiff **CANNOT** use the eggshell plaintiff rule to prove that the defendant committed a tort. It is a rule about how much harm the defendant is liable for, given that the defendant has committed a tort.

An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of such a contact, and a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.
