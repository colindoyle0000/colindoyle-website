# How to Read a Case


![](images/IMG_9979.jpeg)


**Before you begin:**

1. Connect with your core values.
2. Discern your immediate goal.

---

# Why take this preliminary step?

Connecting to core values makes the work easier and more fulfilling.

Discerning a goal allows you to focus your attention on what matters.

---

# There is no escape.

---

# [fit] Stress is a very bad, no good motivator.

---

# Goals when reading a case

1. Grasp the internal logic and mechanics of the case.
2. Synthesize within a broader context.

---

# [] That’s outlining!

---

## An outline outlines the process for arriving at the right answers to familiar questions about unfamiliar facts.

---

# Familiar questions from our negligence defenses
\- Does the defense of contributory negligence apply?
\- Was the plaintiff comparatively negligent?
\- Does the defense of “assumption of risk” apply?
\- How much can the plaintiff recover?
\- How much does each defendant owe?
\- If a particular defendant is absent or insolvent, how much do the other defendants owe?
