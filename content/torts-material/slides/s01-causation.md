# Causation

Two parts:
1. Factual cause
2. Proximate cause

---

# Stubbs v. City of Rochester

---

# [fit] What about two possible causes?

---

# Two different tests for factual causation

1. “But for”
2. Substantial factor

---

# California Jury Instructions

A substantial factor in causing harm is a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to the harm. It must be more than aremote or trivial factor. It does not have to be the only cause of the harm.

[Conduct is not a substantial factor in causing harm if the same harmwould have occurred without that conduct.]

---

# Zuchowicz v. United States

---

# Four typical scenarios in which factual cause may be contested

1. Toxic exposure
2. No idea what happened
3. Know what happened, but don’t know that it wouldn’t have happened if defendant had behaved reasonably
4. Know what happened, but don’t know who to blame
