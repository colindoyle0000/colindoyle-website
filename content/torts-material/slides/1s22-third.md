# Closing Thoughts on Intentional Torts

---

## With intentional torts, always consider 

1. The legal interest that each intentional tort addresses
2. The requirements of the defendant
3. The requirements of the plaintiff
4. Any objective requirements, including analysis that the judge or jury must conduct

---

## The legal interest that each intentional tort addresses

**Battery**

Freedom from harmful or offensive contact

**Assault**

Freedom from apprehension of harmful or offensive contact

**False Imprisonment**

Freedom from confinement

**IIED**

Freedom from emotional distress


---

## Example of False Imprisonment

**1. Legal interest**

Freedom from confinement

**2. Requirements of defendant**

Intentional act to confine

**3. Requirements of the plaintiff**

Aware of confinement (or harmed by it)

**4. Objective requirements**

Plaintiff was confined

# First party insurance

Collateral source rule

Subrogation

---

## Understanding these rules in combination

A defendant injures a plaintiff. The plaintiff’s health insurance provider covers most of the plaintiff’s medical bills. The plaintiff wins a lawsuit against the defendant.

Consider the process and outcomes for this case under three different legal regimes:

1. Only the collateral source rule exists — no subrogation

2. Only subrogation exists — no collateral source rule

3. Both the collateral source rule and subrogation exist (our actual legal regime)

# Straightforward example: a house fire

# But it gets complicated with:

- Personal injury
- Settlement

---

# Liability Insurance

---

## First party insurance
## *versus*
## Third party (liability) insurance

---

# How does liability insurance affect tort law?

1. Changes how damages are paid.
2. Changes what lawsuits are filed.
3. Can affect substantive tort law itself.
4. Can affect policy rationale / justification for legal rules.

# Remember the Rowland Factors?

- foreseeability of harm
- certainty of plaintiff’s injury
- connection between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury
- moral blame
- policy of preventing harm
- burden to defendant
- consequences to community
- **availability of liability insurance**
