# Student Questions

## Technical Questions about the Exam

 
Will we be told in the jurisdictional rules whether we should use contributory or comparative negligence or what form of comparative negligence?

Should we only focus on using the Second Restatement’s definition for strict liability?


---

## Negligence

How does duty vary from an affirmative duty?


How can I define non-negligent injury and non-negligent creation of risk?
 




How do we differentiate when to analyze using the negligence framework and when to separately analyze duty and breach?

 
When we’re analyzing harm for the elements of negligence, do we need to do a full IRAC to prove harm or can we just say there was an injury so harm occurred?



---

## Factual Cause

What’s the deal with the but-for test and the substantial factor test?


Can you explain alternative liability and how it differs from defendants acting in concert?

In Summers v Tice if they can't figure out which defendant was liable would you apportion the liability 50/50 between the defendants? 


Should we apply market share liability when facts show that there are several others injured or is one plaintiff sufficient? Should we discuss it with products liability as well? 


For Toxic Harms, do we have to know about  Mass Torts and multidistrict litigations, or should we only know the three frequent problems that toxic harm cases raise?

---

## Proximate Cause

Is intervening cause used in strict/product liability case and in intentional harm cases?



What am I supposed to understand from Palsgraf exactly?




---

## Defenses

What is the difference between comparative negligence, comparative fault, and comparative responsibility?

Even if a plaintiff's actions can't be an intervening cause for the defendant to escape liability, is there still the possibility they can be found comparatively/contributorily negligent?



Are comparative and contributory negligence the same or are they different, and are applicable only depending on the jdx that we are in? 



Can you explain the key difference between not as great as and no greater than?


If we are in a comparative negligence jurisdiction do we even mention assumption of risk, or should we do the analysis within duty and comparative negligence?



---

## Strict Liability

It seems like we have 4 standards (1) a person who for his own purposes bring onto his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes; 2) same thing but adds non-natural; 3) ultrahazardous activity and 4) abnormally dangerous activity. I am confused if they all work together or which to apply to see if strict liability applies?



What’s the difference between “ultrahazardous activity” and “abnormally dangerous activity”?



How am I supposed to incorporate American Cyanamid’s reasoning that strict liability applies for behavior that is 1) very risky and that risk cannot be avoided at a reasonable cost and 2) not susceptible to due care analysis?


---

# Products Liability

Is the rule of privity relevant? 



For reasonable alternative design, I have in my notes that there are two issues that come up in this space. The first one is at what point are we just in a different category of product. What is the second issue?


When proving design defect, should we always present a reasonable alternative design? At what point does the design of a product become too complex for the court to apply the consumer-expectation test?

 




What do you mean that warnings cannot overcome design defects? 



Can you explain the heeding presumption and how that plays a part in warnings?



Can you explain comparative responsibility and the difference between the two restatements with products liability?



---

## Intentional Torts

Are causation and harm built into the elements we have for intentional torts? Or is that something we have to address separately? 



For battery, does a physical touch necessarily mean that the defendant themselves physically touched the defendent?



Can there be an assault if it was an attempted battery but the plaintiff was not put into reasonable fear or apprehension?


When a defendant says something conditional, can it still be assault? 



For intent for false imprisonment: does the intent need to be intent to confine or intent to confine by threat, assertion of legal authority or barriers?


Is the first amendment a defense to IIED claims?




---



## Damages


When there is an exacerbation of a previous injury, do we find the defendant who exacerbated the injury liable for the initial harm of the accident and then responsible for the unforeseen magnitude of the harm through the eggshell plaintiff rule?



How is the unpaid portion from an insolvent defendant divided among the other defendants in a modern joint-and-several liability jurisdiction? 




What are the differences between alternative liability, joint & several liability, and several liability?
