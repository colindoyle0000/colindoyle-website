# Doctrine of Contribution

**Modern Approach**

Apportionment based on comparative fault.

Example: Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.
A is 40% at fault.
B is 10% at fault.
C is 20% at fault.
D is 30% at fault.

# Doctrine of Contribution

**Modern Approach**

Apportionment based on comparative fault.

Example: Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.
A is 40% at fault. So A owes $40k.
B is 10% at fault. So B owes $10k.
C is 20% at fault. So C owes $20k.
D is 30% at fault. So D owes $30k.

# Don’t

# Don’t forget about factual cause!

Tortfeasors are only liable for the injuries they caused.

# Order of operations with multiple injuries and multiple defendants

**First step:**
Separate injuries based on factual cause.

**Second step:**
For injuries that multiple defendants caused, sort out liability based on the contribution rule in the jurisdiction.
