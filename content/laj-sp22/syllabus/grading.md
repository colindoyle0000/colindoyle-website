## Overview

This course is worth two credits. According to ABA Standard 310, for a two-credit course you are expected to spend at least four hours per week on course-related work outside of class. 

Your grade will be based on:

- Weekly reading responses (25%)
- Class participation (25%)
- Final collaborative project and presentation (50%)

## Weekly Reading Responses
By midnight on the Tuesday before each class, please [email me][1] a 250-500 word reading response to that week’s assigned reading. To be sure that I do not miss your email, please use the subject line “Reading Response.”

Your reading response should articulate your initial reactions to and thoughts about the theories, concepts, arguments, and ideas from the week’s reading. 

I _highly_ encourage you to take notes as you read. Reading without taking notes is not reading at all. Jotting down notes only after finishing the assigned reading will almost always result in a subpar reading response. As you work through your reading assignments, don’t read passively and don’t take anything for granted. As you read, write down questions that come to mind. Ask yourself: What aspects of the author’s argument do you agree and disagree with? Why? Why not? What are the opportunities and limitations of these ideas? What assumptions are being taken for granted? What questions have been left unasked? What questions would you like to ask the author? 

Your reading response should take the form of an edited collection of those notes. With reading responses, you are not expected to have arrived at answers that can resolve difficult and thorny issues. Rather, a good reading response thoughtfully probes at important questions.

These reading responses are not busy work. They are the foundation of our classroom discussions. Each week, I will incorporate your questions and thoughts into our classroom exercises and discussion topics.

## Class Participation
Class preparation is required. I expect that you will come to class having completed the reading and ready to speak about the materials assigned for that day. You are expected to participate actively in class discussions every week.

I also expect you to ask questions of each other in class, and you should always feel free to ask me questions as well. In particular, I would encourage you to ask about anything unclear from the readings. Please don’t be embarrassed to ask about things you don’t understand — there will likely be others with the same question.

## Final Project & Presentation
Final projects should be conducted in teams of 1-3 students. You are encouraged to work in pairs or teams but may work independently if you do not like group work. You must complete a research paper (approximately 10 single-spaced pages) and related presentation (approximately 15-20 minutes) that is inspired by the course material. These projects are an opportunity for you to examine a wider range of techniques, domains, and moral and legal principles than we have covered in class.

Although you have flexibility in constructing these projects, I anticipate that most projects will take one of two forms:

1) Describe the use or potential use of an algorithm in a part of our legal system and analyze the positive and negative implications of this development using the principles and theories explored in class.

2) Analyze how current law and policy may need to adapt to a new development in algorithmic technology.

Students are encouraged to discuss ideas for final projects in class. Later in the semester, we will carve out time in class for students to discuss potential projects and recruit partners and teammates.

To help formulate your final project, students are _highly_ encouraged to schedule office hours with me before the end of March.

Student presentations will be held on our final two weeks of class: ~~April 12th and April 19th~~ April 19th and April 26th.

Final papers are due ~~Wednesday April 26th~~ ~~Wednesday~~ Thursday May 4th (rescheduled because of Week 07 class cancellation). You are encouraged to use the questions and reactions to your in-class presentations to refine your final paper.
