## Lesson 07 - Mar. 1
### Transparency, interpretability, and explainability
In this session we will discuss different approaches to achieve explainability, both from a legal and technical perspective. We will learn about the difference between interpretable algorithms and non-interpretable algorithms, and the difference between transparency ex-ante and transparency ex-post including different auditing methods. We will also discuss the tradeoff between transparency and accuracy, and how balance between the two can be achieved. We will match between different transparency methods and their relevant policy domains, and become familiar with legal concepts such as due process and fair trial; as well as the legal limitations that demand a certain form of transparency. 
- Does a requirement of transparency or explanation in the use of algorithms in decision-making promote fairness? 
- How would it work and what would be limitations?

## Lesson 08 - Mar. 22
### Regulation Part One
This class and the next will exam legal regimes that could be used to govern or regulate the use of algorithms. Our first class will examine the “Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights” that the White House put out this past fall and also the challenge of regulating deep fakes.

As A.I. and machine learning proliferates, what regulations are required? Are our institutions up to the task or is technology’s disruptive power overblown? Where might governmental oversight succeed and where might it fail? What would underegulation and overregulation look like in this space? How could we measure it? What existing rights should the government protect? What new rights ought to be protected in an age of automation?

## Lesson 09 - Mar. 29
### Regulation Part Two


Our second class on regulating algorithms will focus on product liability, using self-driving cars as our case study. Product liability emerged, in part, from the increasing complexity of the supply chain of modern goods and the inherent harm certain products could cause. Is the same approach — or an analogous one — appropriate for dealing with the increasing complexity of algorithms? Or should algorithms be treated like human services? Is there a viable third option, such as universal insurance for harms caused by autonomous vehicles?

Product liability in general, and strict product liability specifically, represent an attempt to regulate the creation and sale of goods by imposing liability for harms caused. Is a regulation-by-incentive approach effective? Is it appropriate for the regulation of algorithms? Where might incentives to create safe, ethical algorithms and artificial intelligences break down? What are other model of assigning redress for the harms caused by technologies such as autonomous vehicles?

## Lesson 10 - Apr. 5
### Litigation
In this class session, we'll be looking at the impact of algorithms in three areas of decision-making that are traditionally protected by civil rights laws: housing, lending, and employment. In the first part of class, we'll consider why private actors might want to use algorithms in housing, lending, and employment decision-making and how those uses might interact with civil rights statutes. On one hand, it seems like algorithmic decision-making is a cure for intentional and unintentional discrimination in _human_ decision-making. On the other hand, empirical studies show that algorithmic decision-making can exhibit bias against protected characteristics such as race or gender, even when these characteristics have been scrubbed from input datasets. What are the tradeoffs between algorithmic and human decision-making when it comes to decisions that disparately impact protected classes? Do we (or should we) think about these tradeoffs differently in the areas of housing, lending, and employment? Readings for this part of class are:
- Matthew Adam Bruckner, [_The Promise and Perils of Algorithmic Lenders’ Use of Big Data_][28], 93 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 3 (2018) (read pp 15-17, skim pp 17-29)
- Ifeoma Ajunwa, [_The Paradox of Automation as Anti-Bias Intervention_][29], 41 Cardozo L. Rev. 1671 (2020) (read pp 1683-1692, skim pp 1692-1707)
For the second part of class, we'll look at potential legal interventions that could address, at least partially, the issue of algorithmic discrimination. Assuming that we find _some_ benefit to algorithmic decision-making (and thus don't opt for an out-right ban), how do we preserve the good while regulating the bad? Should a regulatory agency be nominated - or created - to oversee the deployment of algorithms in areas protected by civil rights laws? Should we create a private right of action against algorithmic discrimination? Or are existing civil rights laws sufficient to address these harms? Readings for this section of class are:
- Matthew Adam Bruckner, [_The Promise and Perils of Algorithmic Lenders’ Use of Big Data_][30], 93 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 3 (2018) (read pp 31-38, skim pp 38-56)
- Ifeoma Ajunwa, [_The Paradox of Automation as Anti-Bias Intervention_][31], 41 Cardozo L. Rev. 1671 (2020) (skim pp 1720-1726, read pp 1726-1734)
