The final exam will count for 75% of your grade.

Your exam packet will include two appendices. Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendices while you take the exam.

When the exam instructions and appendices are completed, copies of both will be provided on this webpage.
