The final exam will count for 75% of your grade. The final exam has five parts and two appendices. Parts I, II, III, and IV are essay questions that involve the same fact pattern. Part IV has a separate fact pattern and essay question. 

Included below are links to PDF versions of the instructions and appendices you will receive when you take the exam. I am providing them here so that you can familiarize yourself with the material before taking the exam.

**Final Instructions** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts2023-material/final/instructions_torts_final_sp24.pdf) 


**Final Appendices** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts2023-material/final/appendices_torts_final_sp24.pdf) 

Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. When you take the final exam, you will receive a copy of these appendices as part of your exam packet. You are allowed to consult those appendices while you take your exam.
