***State v. Stummer* test for constitutionality of content-based secondary effects regulation**

1. To qualify for intermediate scrutiny, State must demonstrate regulation directed at secondary effects, not speech suppression.
2. To survive intermediate scrutiny, State must show regulation does not sweep too broadly. Court must examine: 
   1) whether regulation protects a substantial government interest, and 
   2) whether it significantly reduces secondary effects without unduly interfering with protected speech.
