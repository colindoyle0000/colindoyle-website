# Class discussion with difficult topics

You can speak from the first-person related to views and experiences.

Two requirements:

- a student sharing personal views or experience will not be treated as a stand-in for all members of a group
- personal experience is not a trump card

—

# Class discussion with difficult topics

You are encouraged to develop and test arguments that you do not support.

Developing and thinking through an argument is *not* the same as endorsing that argument.

# In re T.W.
551 So.2d 1186 (Fla. 1989)

—

“Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life except as otherwise provided herein. This section shall not be construed to limit the public’s right of access to public records and meetings as provided by law.”

Art I., §23, Florida Const.

—

## Rule for evaluating constitutionality of government intrusion into private life:

“The right of privacy demands the compelling state interest standard. This test shifts the burden of proof to the state to justify an intrusion on privacy. The burden can be met by demonstrating that the challenged regulation serves a compelling state interest and accomplishes its goal through the use of the least intrusive means.”

# Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Schmidt
440 P.3d 461 (Kan. 2019)

—

“All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

§ 1, Kansas Bill of Rights, Kansas Const.

No State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”

U.S. Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment.

—

## Strict Scrutiny
Does the law further a “compelling governmental interest,” and is it “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest?

## Undue Burden
Does the law have the purpose or effect of imposing an “undue burden,” defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”
