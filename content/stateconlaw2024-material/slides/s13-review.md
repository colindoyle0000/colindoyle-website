# Sequencing

In what order should a state court resolve state and federal constitutional claims?

1. “Primacy” approach
2. “Dual sovereignty” approach
3. “Interstitial” or “Secondary” approach

—

# Equality

—

# Why put equality in a state constitution?

# What’s the purpose?

—

# Conceptions of Equality

Equal treatment → Non-discrimination from the state

Equal opportunity → Minimum state obligation to address existing inequality

Equal outcome → State guarantee to fix existing inequality

—

# Tiers of scrutiny

—

## Rational basis
Applies when no suspect classification is at issue.

To survive judicial review, the law must serve a *legitimate* government interest and there must be a *rational connection* between the law’s means and that interest.

—

## Intermediate scrutiny
Applies to quasi-suspect classifications such as gender.

To survive judicial review, the law must further an *important* government interest and must do so by means that are *substantially related* to that interest.

—

## Strict scrutiny
Applies to suspect classifications such as race, national origin, and religion.

To survive judicial review,  the law must further a *compelling* government interest and law must be *narrowly tailored* to achieve that interest.

—

# Federal Backdrop

Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects 

1. Rights specified within the bill of rights

Fundamental rights are only recognized if they are “deeply rooted in our history and tradition” and “essential to the nation’s concept of ordered liberty.”

# Questions to guide us

How should we understand the differences between policy preferences and constitutional interpretation?

How should a constitution be interpreted?

What constitutional provisions are a legitimate source for a particular right? What is too much of a stretch?

What should be the role of history in our understanding of constitutional provisions? How should stare decisis factor into the analysis?

—

# Right to Privacy

What is it? Do we want a constitutional right to privacy? What should the right protect?

—

# Substantive Due Process: Reproductive Autonomy

**Strict Scrutiny**

Does the law further a “compelling governmental interest,” and is it “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest?

**Undue Burden**

Does the law have the purpose or effect of imposing an “undue burden,” defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability?”

**Rational Basis**

Does the law serve a “legitimate” government interest, and is there a “rational connection” between the law’s means and that interest?
