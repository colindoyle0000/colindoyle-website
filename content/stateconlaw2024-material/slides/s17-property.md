# Questions to guide us for “public use” cases

What should qualify as permissible “public use”?

What are the benefits and drawbacks to stronger or weaker property rights protection against government takings?

How much should our understanding of “public use” depend on differences in the constitutional texts, history, tradition, geography, and demographics?

# Patel v. Texas Dep’t of Licensing
469 S.W.3d 69 (Tex. 2015)

—

“No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land.”
Texas Const., Art. I, § 19

# A mess of standards of review

1) real and substantial
2) rational basis including consideration of evidence
3) no-evidence rational basis

—

# A new standard

To find a statute unconstitutional under Art. I, § 19, plaintiffs must prove either: 

1) the statute’s purpose could not arguably be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest; or
2) when considered as a whole, the statute’s actual, real-world effect as applied to the challenging party could not arguably be rationally related to, or is so burdensome as to be oppressive in light of, the government interest

—

*Similar federal standards*

**Rational basis**: To survive judicial review, the law must serve a *legitimate* government interest and there must be a *rational connection* between the law’s means and that interest.

**Intermediate scrutiny**: To survive judicial review, the law must further an *important* government interest and must do so by means that are *substantially related* to that interest.
