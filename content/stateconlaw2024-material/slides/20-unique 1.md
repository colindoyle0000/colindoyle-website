# *Privacy*

—

# York v. Wahkiakum School District No. 200
178 P.3d 995 (Wash. 2008)

“No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.” Wash. Const. Art. I, § 7.

**Two-part analysis**
1. Was this a disturbance of one’s private affairs?
2. If so, does authority of law justify the intrusion?

—

# *Free Speech*

—

# Fashion Valley Mall v. NLRB
172 P.3d 742 (Cal. 2007)

“Every person may freely speak, write and publish his or her statements on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.” Cal. Const., Art. I, § 2.

Compare with, “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...” U.S. Const. Am. 1.

# Justify the difference under *Fashion Valley*

Protestors want to distribute leaflets near the store, discouraging people from shopping there and costing the store $10,000 in revenue. It is unconstitutional for Fashion Valley to force the protestors to protest elsewhere.

# State v. Stummer
194 P.3d 1043 (Ariz. 2008)

“Every person may freely speak, write, and publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.” Ariz. Const. Art. II, § 6.

—

***State v. Stummer* test for constitutionality of content-based secondary effects regulation**
1. To qualify for intermediate scrutiny, State must demonstrate regulation directed at secondary effects, not speech suppression.
2. To survive intermediate scrutiny, State must show regulation does not sweep too broadly. Court must examine 1) whether regulation protects substantial government interest and 2) whether it significantly reduces secondary effects without unduly interfering with protected speech.

—

# *Civil Jury Trial*

“In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.” U.S. Const. Am. 7.

—

# Sofie v. Fibreboard Corp.
771 P.2d 711 (Wash. 1989)

“The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate, but the legislature may provide for a jury of any number less than twelve in courts not of record, and for a verdict by nine or more jurors in civil cases in any court of record, and for waiving of the jury in civil cases where the consent of the parties interested is given thereto.” Wash. Const., Art. I, § 21.
