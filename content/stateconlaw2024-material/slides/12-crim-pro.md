# Questions to guide us

How should we understand the differences between policy preferences and constitutional interpretation?

How should a constitution be interpreted? What should be the role of history in our understanding of constitutional provisions?

What constitutional provisions are a legitimate source for a particular right? What is too much of a stretch?

How should stare decisis factor into the analysis?

# Questions to guide us for search and seizure

What is the nature of a right “against unreasonable searches and seizures”? How should that right be protected?

If search warrants require probable cause, what is probable cause? When is a warrantless search still reasonable?

How should stare decisis factor into constitutional interpretation, particularly when federal and state precedents are intertwined?
