# In-Class Exercise:

Congress has passed a law banning potluck suppers that do not include corn as a dish.

Would-be potluckers from the state of Oregon have sued U.S. government, arguing that the law is unconstitutional because it is beyond Congress’s authority under Art. I § 8 of the federal constitution.

The case makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. You are Supreme Court justices. One half of the class will write the opinion upholding the law. The other half of the class will write the opinion finding the law unconstitutional.
