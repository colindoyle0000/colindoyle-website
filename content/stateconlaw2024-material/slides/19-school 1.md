# Questions to guide us for school funding cases

Does the state constitution provide a fundamental right to education? Or are public education clauses only a duty imposed on the legislature?

What are the differences between equality, adequacy, and uniformity?

How should a court determine whether school funding laws are unequal, inadequate, or not uniform?

If a school funding scheme is unconstitutional, what remedies should a court impose? How should the judiciary balance power and relationships with the legislative and executive branches?
