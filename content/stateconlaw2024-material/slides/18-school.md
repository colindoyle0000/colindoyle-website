# Patel v. Texas Dep’t of Licensing
469 S.W.3d 69 (Tex. 2015)

—

“No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land.”
Texas Const., Art. I, § 19

—

# A mess of standards of review

1) real and substantial
2) rational basis including consideration of evidence
3) no-evidence rational basis

—

# A new standard

To find a statute unconstitutional under Art. I, § 19, plaintiffs must prove either: 
1) the statute’s purpose could not arguably be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest; or
2) when considered as a whole, the statute’s actual, real-world effect as applied to the challenging party could not arguably be rationally related to, or is so burdensome as to be oppressive in light of, the government interest

—

*Similar federal standards*

**Rational basis**: To survive judicial review, the law must serve a *legitimate* government interest and there must be a *rational connection* between the law’s means and that interest.

**Intermediate scrutiny**: To survive judicial review, the law must further an *important* government interest and must do so by means that are *substantially related* to that interest.
