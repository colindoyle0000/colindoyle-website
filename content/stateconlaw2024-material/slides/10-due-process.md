551 So.2d 1186 (Fla. 1989)

## Rule for evaluating constitutionality of government intrusion into private life:

“The right of privacy demands the compelling state interest standard. This test shifts the burden of proof to the state to justify an intrusion on privacy. The burden can be met by demonstrating that the challenged regulation serves a compelling state interest and accomplishes its goal through the use of the least intrusive means.”
