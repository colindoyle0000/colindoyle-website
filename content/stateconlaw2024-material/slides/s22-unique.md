# Questions for Delaware Supreme Court

1. May “reasonable cause” include an indictment?
2. Does the authority to remove a public official implicitly include the authority to take a lesser action, such as suspension of that public official? If so, must the General Assembly address the Governor on the lesser action?
3. Does the process require a hearing prior to a vote?
4. Does the 10-day notice requirements apply for only the first House or are separate notices required for each House? May those notices be issued concurrently?
5. Is there a mechanism for an appeal?
