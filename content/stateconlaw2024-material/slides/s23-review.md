—

# Tiers of scrutiny

—

## Rational basis
Applies when no suspect classification is at issue.

To survive judicial review, the law must serve a *legitimate* government interest and there must be a *rational connection* between the law’s means and that interest.

—

## Intermediate scrutiny
Applies to quasi-suspect classifications such as gender.

To survive judicial review, the law must further an *important* government interest and must do so by means that are *substantially related* to that interest.

—

## Strict scrutiny
Applies to suspect classifications such as race, national origin, and religion.

To survive judicial review,  the law must further a *compelling* government interest and law must be *narrowly tailored* to achieve that interest.
