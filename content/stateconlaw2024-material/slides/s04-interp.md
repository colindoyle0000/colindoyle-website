Makes it unlawful for an “employer” “to discharge any individual” who is at least 40 years old “because of such individual’s age.” The term “employer” is defined to include “a State or political subdivision of a State,” but exempts as “employees” persons appointed “at the policymaking level.”

## What are some reasons to follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s interpretation of a similarly worded provision?

- Uniformity
- Deference
	- Don’t rock the boat
	- Superior knowledge? Or just better litigation? Better litigants? Better amicus briefs?

In sum, the balance of the State’s interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program. We therefore hold that it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.
