## Course Website
You're on the course website right now. I will also use our course Brightspace platform to make announcements and to host content that cannot be shared publicly, like our class recordings. The Brightspace page address is: <br>[https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/183850/Home](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/183850/Home).

## Class Recordings
Video recordings of class will be posted on Brightspace by the Instructional Technology Department as soon as they are received and processed.

Following the first day of class, I will give each student access to a shared folder that I maintain that contains audio recordings and automated transcriptions of each of our class sessions.

Please note that recording or sharing all or a portion of class (video, audio, or photo) without the express permission of the law school is forbidden.

## Laptops in Class
I am reluctant to allow laptops to be used in the classroom. Laptops invite distraction, both for the student using the laptop and the students sitting nearby. At the same time, I recognize that many students prefer to take notes on their computers, that typing handwritten notes can be arduous, and that a "no laptops" policy creates a bureacratic hurdle for students who need accommodations.

I am provisionally allowing laptops to be used for taking notes during class. If I find that laptops are proving to be too much of a distraction, that policy will change. If you choose to use a laptop in class, I ask that you only use the laptop for taking notes and looking at class slides. You should turn off notifications, close your email, and minimize your browser windows.
