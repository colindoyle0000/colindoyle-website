## Contact information
Colin.Doyle@lls.edu <br>
Office: Burns 315 <br>
Telephone: 213-736-1148

Email is my preferred method of communication. I do not regularly check my phone voicemail. If you have something important to communicate, use email.

Please note that although you may email me substantive questions, I typically do not answer substantive questions in an individual email reply. I prefer to answer substantive questions during office hours or immediately after class. If your question is of general interest, I will share my answer with the entire class.

My faculty assistant is Colin Goward, and his email is: [Colin.Goward@lls.edu](mailto:Colin.Goward@lls.edu)

During open office hours, any student or group of students from our class may stop by without an appointment. Anyone in the class is welcome to join or leave during that time. Please know that I _love_ office hours. While I am always up for talking about torts, I am also happy to talk about anything you’re interested in discussing: navigating law school, legal careers, the research I’m conducting when I’m not teaching, the latest season of the Great British Bakeoff — anything is fair game. Maybe I'll have cookies or brownies to share. Show up to find out.

## One-on-one office hours
By appointment in Burns 315. To schedule an appointment, [email me](mailto:colin.doyle@lls.edu?subject=One-on-One%20Office%20Hours).

Please note that open office hours are the norm, and one-on-one office hours are the exception. If you have a question about tort law or about the class itself, I recommend that you ask this question during open office hours. One-on-one office hours are available for students who cannot attend open office hours or who wish to have a private conversation about something other than substantive tort law.



## Reading Assignments

To allow for this course to be flexible in response to the pace and dynamics of our in-class discussions, reading assignments will be scheduled on a rolling basis. To allow you enough time to read the assigned material, I plan to post reading assignments at least one week in advance of class. Once I have assigned the reading for a particular class, I will not change the reading.

Unless otherwise noted, all page numbers refer to the required textbook for the class, [Franklin, Rabin & Green, Tort Law and Alternatives: Cases and Materials (11th ed. 2021)](https://www.westacademic.com/Franklin-Rabin-Green-and-Geistfelds-Tort-Law-and-Alternatives-Cases-and-Materials-11th-9781647084899). I will provide links for supplementary materials.

As I assign readings to particular class dates, the reading assignments will appear both in the _ page on this website and on a [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vtu22g9khnc4acg3plvuaarptc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles). You can view and bookmark this calendar [in a separate browser window](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vtu22g9khnc4acg3plvuaarptc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles). With a Google account, you can [subscribe to the calendar with read-only access](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/5?cid=dnR1MjJnOWtobmM0YWNnM3BsdnVhYXJwdGNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). If you subscribe to the calendar, you can turn on notifications to automatically receive an email when new reading assignments are added. Here's how to do that:

2. Click on the three dots next to the calendar nam.
