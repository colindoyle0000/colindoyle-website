For members of our class, audio recordings and transcripts are available [here](https://otter.ai/group/2136062). The link will only work for people whom I have invited to join the group "Torts Fall 2022." Following our first class, I sent an invite link to each student in our class. You will also need to created an account with the hosting platform, Otter.ai. If you are unable to access the audio recordings and transcripts, please [email me](mailto:Colin.Doyle@lls.edu).

You will find that the Otter.ai platform allows you to correct the transcripts, make highlights, and add comments. You should know that these changes will be visible to the entire class. I encourage you to use the transcript as a collaborative document. You should feel free to make corrections to the transcript and to highlight material you find important or useful.
