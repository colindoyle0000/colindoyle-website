## Class 18 - October 24, 2022

You are the law clerk to a Supreme Court justice in the state of Loyola. The justice wants to discuss with you a new case coming up on appeal. She shares with you the following history of the case so far:

The plaintiff, Adrianna Blackwell, sued the defendant, Dominic Pope, for negligence. Blackwell alleges that Pope negligently allowed gasoline to leak from an underground gasoline tank, contaminating the plaintiff’s well, which the plaintiff relied upon for drinking water and other household purposes.

The plaintiff’s home borders Dominic Pope’s property to the North and a state highway to the East. The well on the plaintiff’s property was equidistant to the site of the gasoline tank on Pope’s property and the state highway.

About ten years ago, Pope installed an underground gasoline tank and pump on his property. The tank was installed about one foot under the surface of the ground and was connected with the pump by pipes. Two months after the tank was installed, the plaintiff began to smell and taste gasoline in her drinking water. At trial, a number of witnesses testified that the water from the plaintiff’s well tasted of gasoline and could be lit on fire with a match. Prior to the gasoline tank being installed, no gasoline had ever been detected in the plaintiff’s well.

The defendant, Pope, had paid Andrew Huber, a professional gasoline tank installer, to install the tank for him. Evidence was introduced at trial to show that the tank was a new tank stamped with an inspection sticker (as required by law for quality control). The plumbing was completed by professional plumbers; the fittings were examined after being installed; and the pipes were checked each time that the tank was filled to ensure that no gasoline was leaking out through any fixtures on the tank or through the pump itself.

Russell Bollinger, the plaintiff’s mailperson, testified for the plaintiff that he had seen the tank being installed when out on his mail route. He testified, “It looked like an old outfit, rusty, had dirt on it, looked like they had taken it out of some place and installed it there without making changes on the fittings or retreading the pipes.” On cross-examination, he stated that “I was there just a few minutes. The tank was laying on top of the ground. I made no particular examination of that tank. When I went to the post office I glanced over and saw they were installing something. I saw the tank, looked at it a few seconds, I never went on the property. I don't think I was there over a minute.”

Before intitiating the lawsuit, Blackwell brought up the issue with the defendant, Pope. He drank some water from her well and told her that it did not taste or smell of gasoline. To reassure her about the gasoline tank, he pointed to a meter on the tank and told Blackwell that the readings on the meter showed that no gasoline was leaking out. At trial, Pope admitted that the meter on the tank did no such thing. After meeting with the plaintiff, Pope called Huber, the tank installer, to ask about a potential leak. Huber assured the defendant that the tank had been installed properly and that there was nothing to worry about. The defendant asked Huber if they could dig around the tank to discover if there were any holes on the bottom but Huber told him that “no one does that for a small tank like this,” that the operation would risk creating an actual gasoline leak, and that it would cost Pope less to get water coolers delivered to the plaintiff’s house.

The plaintiff sought to prove the defendant’s negligence according to two different legal theories. The first theory was res ipsa loquitur. The second theory was that the defendant had not exercised reasonable care when installing the gasoline tank and when addressing the problem of the gasoline leak after the plaintiff alerted the defendant to the problem.

Over the plaintiff’s objection, the trial judge did not instruct the jury on res ipsa loquitur. Following controlling precedent from our court, the trial judge ruled that the plaintiff had an opportunity either to prove negligence through specific acts or to prove negligence through res ipsa loquitur, but the plaintiff was not allowed to present both grounds for liability to the jury. In the jurisdiction of Loyola, res ipsa loquitur does not create a rebuttable presumption of negligence, but a jury may rely upon res ipsa loquitur to infer that a defendant was negligent.

Before you dig into the briefs that the parties have filed and the details of the record below, the justice would like to know your initial answers to three questions: 

1. Was the defendant negligent? 
2. If you were the attorney for the plaintiff, and you had the opportunity to prove negligence relying upon either res ipsa or specific acts but not both, which would you choose? Why?
3. With this case, our court will have an opportunity to revisit our rule requiring plaintiffs to choose between relying on res ipsa or relying on specific acts to prove negligence. Should we change this rule? What difference would it make?

## Class 15 - October 12, 2022

## In-Class Exercise for Res Ipsa Loquitur:

You are an appellate court judge in the state of Loyola. The following case comes to you on appeal from a trial court. You should take notes on the opinion that you would write in this case and be prepared to share your thoughts with the class.

The defendant parked his car on an incline. Three children sat in the rear seat of the car; it was a 4-door sedan, and none of them got in the front seat. The children testified that none of them touched any of the control mechanisms of the car and that “something clicked in the front and the car started rolling” backwards in the direction of a large ditch. One of the children opened the door and told the others to jump out. All of the children jumped out. When the plaintiff jumped out, he fell, and the front wheel ran over him, causing serious injury. There is no evidence as to the condition of the brakes, whether the handbrake had been set, or whether the car was in gear.

At trial, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent and that the doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* applies. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the trial court ordered a directed verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff now appeals.

How do you rule and why?

## Class 13 - October 3, 2022
## In-Class Exercise: Moore v. Myers
### Prompt

You are an appellate court judge in the state of Loyola. The following case comes to you on appeal from a trial court.

In the first part of this exercise, you should take notes on the opinion that you would write in this case.

In the second part of this exercise, you will confer with the other judges on this appellate panel and decide the case together. After conferring with colleagues, it may be that you arrive at one unanimous opinion. Or it may be that some members of the panel concur or dissent. As a reminder: concurrences arrive at the same holding as the majority opinion but for different reasons, and dissents arrive at a different holding than the majority opinion.

In the third of this exercise, you will report back to the class.

### Background

Twelve-year-old Monica Graham was struck by a car while fleeing a neighbor's advancing pit bull. The dog was, at that time, both unleashed and unconfined, in violation of state law.

Seeking damages for her daughter's injuries, Monica's mother, appellant Mattie Moore, brought a negligence action on behalf of herself and her daughter against the owner of the dog, Michael Myers; his wife, Jeanne Griffin Myers; and her fifteen year-old son, Jaton Griffin.

At the conclusion of plaintiff's case, the defense motioned for a directed verdict, and the trial court granted judgment in favor of the defendants as to all counts. The plaintiff now appeals that ruling.

### Appellant's Case
#### Monica Graham's Testimony
Monica testified that on July 18, 1999, she and three friends were walking along Columbia Park Road, not far from her residence. As the girls approached the Myerses' home, at 7104 Columbia Park Road, Monica saw Jaton and two other boys, Heath and Nathaniel, “standing by the steps [of the house] with a dog.” Monica knew all three boys either from school or from the neighborhood.
The dog was a pit bull. It was unleashed and standing between Jaton and Heath, in an unenclosed front yard. In front of the Myerses' house, Jaton and one of Monica's friends, Showna, got into an argument. At that point, Jaton threatened to “sic his dog on” the girls. When he purportedly “said something to the dog to make the dog ... aggressive,” the dog barked at the girls and started towards Monica, “like it was coming after” her. As it approached, Monica “got scared,” turned and ran into the path of Ms. Young's oncoming car. The car hit Monica, leaving her with two broken arms, a broken leg, and a fractured jaw.

#### Michael Myers's Deposition Testimony
Appellant read portions of Mr. Myers's deposition testimony into the record. Myers deponed that he owned the pit bull. He insisted, however, that the dog had never bitten anyone, except during personal protection training when the dog bit a protective sleeve. He also stated that he regularly allowed Jaton to play with the pit bull in front of his house, and did not require Jaton to put the dog on a leash.
On his way home on the date of the accident, he saw a group of girls walking along Columbia Park Road, headed in the direction of his house. He stated that, when he got home, “[he] walked past Jaton,” who was “by the steps with the dog.” As he entered his house, he heard the slamming of car brakes.

#### Mia Young's Deposition Testimony
Excerpts from the deposition of Mia Young were read into the record. The excerpts disclosed that, as Ms. Young drove down Columbia Park Road towards the Myerses' house, she observed three girls running in the street, with a dog in pursuit. She noted that the dog wore a leash, that it “was behind the children,” and that it looked like it was chasing them. Ms. Young testified that she only saw Monica for a second, before she struck Monica with her car. 

#### Appellees' Defense
For his convenience, Officer Stanley was permitted to testify during the presentation of appellant's case, even though he was called by the defense. The officer testified that when he arrived at the scene of Monica's accident, he was not told by anyone that a dog had been involved in the accident. Officer Stanley testified that, in investigating the accident, “there was no indication of any involvement of a pit bull and neither animal control nor any related agency was called to investigate any violation of the City Ordinance.”

#### Trial Court Ruling
At the conclusion of plaintiff's case, the defense motioned for a directed verdict, and the trial court granted judgment in favor of the defendants as to all counts. The trial court found that, although there was sufficient evidence to prove that the defendants had violated the pitbull ordinance, the purpose of this ordinance was not to protect people from the kind of harm the plaintiff suffered (a car accident). Therefore, the trial court found that the defendants were not negligent as a matter of law.

The plaintiff now appeals the trial court’s ruling on the motion for a directed verdict. This court will review the trial court’s ruling *de novo*.

#### Text of Relevant Statute
> [a]ny person owning a Pit Bull Terrier prior to November 1, 1996, may continue to harbor the animal on his premises under the following conditions:
> 
> ....
> 
> (3) The owner shall maintain the dog within a building or a secure kennel at all times. Whenever the dog is removed from the building or kennel it shall be secured by an unbreakable or unseverable leash and maintained under the control of an adult.


## Class Six - September 8, 2022

### Hershovitz v. Speedy Pete Pizza Pies

The only issue on appeal to Loyola Supreme Court is whether the jury's punitive damages award violates Speedy Pete's constitutional right to due process.

Speedy Pete Pizza Pies is a national pizza chain that promises to deliver pizzas within fifteen minutes or it is free. As a result of this policy, their delivery drivers get in a lot of car accidents. The plaintiff, Scott Hershovitz, suffered minor injuries when a Speedy Pete delivery driver rear-ended him at a stop sign while out on delivery.

Hershovitz sued Speedy Pete for negligence. A jury found Speedy Pete liable and awarded Hershovitz both compensatory and punitive damages.

Compensatory damages: $15,000 <br>
Punitive damages: $314,159

For considering punitive damages, the jury heard testimony from Speedy Pete workers within the state of Loyola and within the state of Nebraska, where Speedy Pete is headquartered. The Loyola-located workers testified to management imposing strict rules about delivery drivers delivering on-time, including punishments like docked pay. The Nebraska-located workers testified to the Speedy Pete national office instructing managers across the country 1) to tell their delivery drivers to obey all traffic laws, and to follow up this instruction with a playful wink (or wink emoji if the instruction was communicated over text); and 2) to tell their delivery drivers that if they got in a car accident they should remove the *Speedy Pete Pizza Pies* decal from the side of their vehicle and tell any people they injured, "I'm so sorry. My blood sugar is running low, which is why I bought all of these pizzas that are in my car. I would love to give you a free slice if you could write your signature on this waiver of liability I just happen to have on me."

The delivery driver who injured Hershovitz testified that she did remember receiving these instructions, but forgot to follow them exactly. After rear-ending Hershovitz, the driver removed the car decal, offered Hershovitze a slice of pizza but did not ask him to sign a waiver of liability. When he asked her why she hit him, she told him that she worked for Speedy Pete and had been rushing to deliver a pizza.

In the State of Loyola, Speedy Pete could face civil penalties of up to $100,000 for instructing employees to hide that they were working for their employer in the event of an accident. In other states like Nebraska, Speedy Pete would not face civil penalties.

### Your Job
You have ten minutes to prepare for oral argument for both plaintiff and defendant.

Plaintiff goal: Convince the court that the award amount is constitutional.

Defendant goal: Convince the court that the award amount is unconstitutional.

*Use* the legal tests we just went over in class.
*Draw* upon and *analogize to* the reasoning from today's cases.

When we reconvene, I will cold call random students and we will workshop your arguments together.

## Class Four - September 1, 2022

**Jury Exercise**

Form teams of six.

You are a jury, determining damages in the following case.

The giant donut at Randy's Donuts fell down, crushing the plaintif, Cindy Estrada. You have already determined that the proprieters of Randy's Donuts are liable for negligence and have calculated compensatory damages for expenses that Estrada has already incurred. But your role as factfinder is not over: 

**You must now determine the plaintiff's compensatory damages for future economic loss and pain and suffering.**

### Jury Instructions

The judge has given you California’s standard jury instruction on damages for pain and suffering: 

> Reasonable compensation for any pain, discomfort, fears, anxiety and other mental and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff and caused by the injury. 

> No definite standard is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for pain and suffering. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for pain and suffering you should exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix must be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence.

The judge has also instructed you that under California law, a jury cannot reduce damages for lost future earnings for personal injury when those reductions are based on race, gender, or ethnicity.

### Plaintiff Information

_Occupation:_ Stay-at-home parent

_Income:_ None. Prior to deciding to become a stay-at-home parent, Estrada earned $40,000 a year as an office coordinator. The plaintiff decided to stay at home to offset daycare expenses ($30,000 a year) while her children were little (currently ages two and four) and had planned to return to the workforce when children were in school fulltime. The plaintiff had aspirations of going to law school and had purchased a series of LSAT prepbooks.

_Future medical expenses:_ The plaintiff will need ongoing treatment for back injuries. Expenses for the past year were $100,000. Treatment should be similar for the rest of plaintiff's natural life (life expectancy of ~40 years).

_Pain and suffering:_ The plaintiff suffers chronic pain daily, has endured multiple surgeries, and future surgery may be necessary. 

Estrada cannot walk more than a few blocks at one time without stopping to rest. She must regularly adjust her sitting position to feel comfortable. The plaintiff feels deep shame and embarrassment for the injury that she sustained and now rarely goes out in public. 

Estrada used to be a member of an indoor soccer team and will never play soccer again. She used to enjoy international travel but she does not feel capable of enduring the pain of sitting in an airplane seat for that stretch of time. Since her injury she has picked up crochet as a hobby, which she enjoys very much.



## Class Three - August 30, 2022

You are a judge in the state of Loyola tasked with writing the opinion of the court in the following case. No precedent binds you on the legal issues here, but it is customary to reference the reasoning of decisions from other jurisdictions when deciding an issue of first impression. The facts of the case are as follows:

Luna Adams found that her car's brakes were squeaking. She brought the car in to be seen by her mechanic, Naomi Donald. Donald replaced the brake pads. A week later, Adams was driving when the brakes on her car failed, causing her to run off the road and crash into a tree. Adams sued Donald for personal injuries and property damages. The case went to a jury trial. Adams motioned for summary judgment, under the legal theory that when a car mechanic fixes a part of a car, that mechanic is strictly liable for all injuries proximately caused by that part of the car failing. The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that negligence, not strict liability, governed. The plaintiff appeals the denial of that motion.

### The Facts

On a Tuesday afternoon, Thomas Jenner lost control of the car he was driving and crashed into the side of a bicycle shop. 

His car went through the wall of the bicycle shop, injuring the owner of the bicycle shop, Maxine Hammontree.

It turns out that Thomas Jenner had a history of epilepsy. On this day, he lost control of his car because he had an epileptic seizure and became unconscious. Jenner has no memory of the incident. He remembers driving, and then he remembers being pulled from the vehicle by EMT’s. Jenner reports that prior to the accident there were no warning signs that he was about to have a seizure.

Jenner first began receiving treatment for epilepsy fifteen years ago. He regularly takes anti-seizure medication and has done everything his doctors have advised him to do to address his epilepsy. As a result of his condition, he needs a doctor to sign off yearly with the DMV for him to have a license. His doctor has signed off with the DMV.

Many new cars have automatic collision avoidance systems that can help prevent these kinds of accidents from occurring. The car will automatically brake to prevent a forward collision from happening. Thomas Jenner was driving a 2020 GM Spark that did not have this anti-collision system as an available feature.

### The Legal Questions

1. Who  — if anyone — should be held liable for these injuries to the plaintiff?
2. What kind of remedy should the plaintiff receive?

### Potential Defendants:
1. Thomas Jenner

2. Thomas Jenner's Doctor

3. General Motors

### The Lawyers for the Plaintiff 

Why should this defendant be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

What remedy does the defendant owe Ms. Hammontree?

### The Lawyers for the Defendants

Why should your client not be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

If your client is found liable, what remedy should they owe Ms. Hammontree?

### Explain your reasoning 
You must appeal to some kind of general rule or principle that would apply in similar cases.
