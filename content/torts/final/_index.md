The final exam has four parts and two appendices.

Part I consists of four short answer questions. Part II consists of a fact pattern and an essay question. Part III consists of a fact pattern and an essay question. Part IV con-sists of a fact pattern and an essay question. The four parts are equally weighted at 25% of your total grade.

The midterm exam will count for 25% of your grade, and the final exam will count for 75%.

Included below are links to PDF versions of the instructions and appendices you will receive when you take the exam. I am providing them here so that you can familiarize yourself with the material before taking the exam.

**Final Instructions** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts-material/final-instructions.pdf) 


**Final Appendices** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts-material/final-appendices.pdf) 

Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. When you take the final exam, you will receive a copy of these appendices as part of your exam packet. You are allowed to consult those appendices while you take your exam.
