## Laptops in Class
This class has a minimal laptop use policy.

Students are expected to take notes by hand. A student may take notes using an electronic tablet and stylus provided that the student use the tablet as they would use a physical notebook and does not use other features of the device during class.

When answering a question in class, students are allowed to briefly use their laptop to look at their notes or the casebook. In general, class participation should be extemporaneous and does not require consulting these materials.

Students will often be allowed to use laptops for in-class exercises, particularly when the text for those exercises is on the course website and is too large to fit onto a slide.

Students who have auditory processing challenges may use laptops for following along with the Otter.ai transcript as a form of closed captioning for the class. If you would like to have Otter.ai open during class, please email me. I am happy to allow the accommodation for any students who find it helpful.

## Course Website
You're on the [course website](http://www.colin-doyle.net/torts2023/) right now. I may also use our course [Brightspace page](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/home/217728) to make announcements and to host content that cannot be shared publicly.

## Class Recordings
The Instructional Technology Department will post video recordings of class [here](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/home/217728) as soon as the video files have been received and processed.

Following the first day of class, I will give each student access to a shared folder that I maintain that contains audio recordings and automated transcriptions of each of our class sessions.

Please note that you are not allowed to record or share all or a portion of classes at Loyola Law School (video, audio, or photo) without the express permission of your instructor or the law school administration.

## Slides
In general, I will post a copy of my [slides](/torts2023/course-content/slides) to this website in the afternoon following our class.
