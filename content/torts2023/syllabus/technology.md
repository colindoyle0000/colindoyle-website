## Laptops in Class
I am reluctant to allow laptops to be used in the classroom. Laptops invite distraction, both for the student using the laptop and the students sitting nearby. At the same time, I recognize that many students prefer to take notes on their computers, that typing handwritten notes can be arduous, and that a “no laptops” policy creates a bureacratic hurdle for students who need accommodations. Also, I put all of your reading assignments in a .pdf instead of assigning you a hardcopy casebook.

I am allowing laptops to be used during class for taking notes and referencing reading assignments. If I find that laptops are proving to be too much of a distraction, that policy will change. If you choose to use a laptop in class, I ask that you only use the laptop for taking notes and looking at your reading assignments. You should turn off notifications, close your email, and minimize your browser windows.

## Course Website
You're on the [course website](http://www.colin-doyle.net/torts/) right now. I may also use our course [Brightspace page](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/home/217728) to make announcements and to host content that cannot be shared publicly.

## Class Recordings
The Instructional Technology Department will post video recordings of class [here](https://echo360.org/section/5552db9a-6979-43ae-a254-7c03a501c03e/home) as soon as the video files have been received and processed.

Following the first day of class, I will give each student access to a shared folder that I maintain that contains audio recordings and automated transcriptions of each of our class sessions.

Please note that you are not allowed to record or share all or a portion of classes at Loyola Law School (video, audio, or photo) without the express permission of your instructor or the law school administration.

## Slides
In general, I will post a copy of my [slides](/torts2023/course-content/slides) to this website in the afternoon following our class.
