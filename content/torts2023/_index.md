## Welcome to Torts!

In this course we will study different ways that our legal system allows people to be compensated for civil wrongs and injuries.

Before the first day of class, please familiarize yourself with this website, read the syllabus, and read your first reading assignment “01 - Welcome!” 

You do not need to purchase a casebook for this class. You can download a pdf of your fall reading assignments [here](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/217728/viewContent/2596795/View). You can download a pdf of your spring reading assignments [here](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/231506/viewContent/2917870/View). Please note that you will need to log in to Brightspace to access this material.

I would also like to invite you to fill out an entirely optional [“Get to Know You” Survey](https://forms.gle/fCUAo6Z3AA5HYEcb7). I will be collecting and reading responses through the first week of class.
