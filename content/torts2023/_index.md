## Welcome to Torts!

In this course we will study different ways that our legal system allows people to be compensated for civil wrongs and injuries.

Before the first day of class, please familiarize yourself with this website, read the syllabus, and read your first reading assignment “01 - Welcome!” 

You do not need to purchase a casebook for this class. A free downloadable .PDF of your reading assignments can be found on the “Reading Assignments” page of this website. 

I would also like to invite you to fill out an entirely optional [“Get to Know You” Survey](https://forms.gle/fCUAo6Z3AA5HYEcb7). I will be collecting and reading responses through the first week of class.
