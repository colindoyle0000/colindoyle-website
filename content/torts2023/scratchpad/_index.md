### Oral argument: Appealing a Punitive Damages Award

### Hershovitz v. Speedy Pete Pizza Pies

When we reconvene for class on Tuesday, we will moot oral arguments for a case on appeal before the Loyola Supreme Court. 

Odd-numbered groups (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) are attorneys for the plaintiff.
Even-numbered groups (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) are attorneys for the defendant.

On Tuesday, I will cold call students at random to present their arguments. I will ask follow-up questions, and I will call on students representing the opposing side to address the points that have been made.

The only legal issue on appeal in this case is whether the punitive damages award is excessive and would deprive the defendant of its property without due process of law.

*Use* the legal tests we just went over in class.
*Draw* upon and *analogize to* the reasoning from these cases.

The facts of the case:

Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies is a national pizza chain that promises to deliver pizzas within fifteen minutes or it is free. As a result of this policy, their delivery drivers get in a lot of car accidents. The plaintiff, Scott Hershovitz, suffered minor injuries when a Speedy Pete’s delivery driver rear-ended him at a stop sign while out for delivery.

Hershovitz sued Speedy Pete’s for negligence. A jury found Speedy Pete’s liable and awarded Hershovitz both compensatory and punitive damages.

Compensatory damages: $15,000 <br>
Punitive damages: $314,159

For considering punitive damages, the jury heard testimony from Speedy Pete’s workers within the state of Loyola and within the state of Nebraska, where Speedy Pete’s is headquartered. The Loyola-located workers testified to management imposing strict rules about delivery drivers delivering on time, including punishments like docked pay. The Nebraska-located workers testified to the Speedy Pete’s national office instructing managers across the country: 1) to tell their delivery drivers to obey all traffic laws, and to follow up this instruction with a playful wink (or wink emoji if the instruction was communicated over text); and 2) to tell their delivery drivers that if they got in a car accident they should remove the *Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies* decal from the side of their vehicle and tell any people they injured, “I'm so sorry. My blood sugar is running low, which is why I bought all of these pizzas that are in my car. I would love to give you a free slice if you could write your signature on this waiver of liability I just happen to have on me.”

The delivery driver who injured Hershovitz testified that she did remember receiving these instructions, but forgot to follow them exactly. After rear-ending Hershovitz, the driver removed the car decal, offered Hershovitze a slice of pizza but did not ask him to sign a waiver of liability. When he asked her why she hit him, she told him that she worked for Speedy Pete’s and had been rushing to deliver a pizza.

In the State of Loyola, Speedy Pete’s could face civil penalties of up to $100,000 for instructing employees to hide that they were working for their employer in the event of an accident. In other states like Nebraska, Speedy Pete’s would not face civil penalties.

The State of Loyola permits a jury to award punitive damages if the defendant’s tortious conduct was “willful and wanton.”

**Jury Exercise**

You are a jury, determining damages in the following case.

The giant donut at Randy's Donuts fell down, crushing the plaintiff, Cindy Estrada. You have already determined that the proprieters of Randy's Donuts are liable for negligence and have calculated compensatory damages for expenses that Estrada has already incurred. But your role as factfinder is not over: 

**You must now determine the plaintiff's compensatory damages for future economic loss and pain and suffering.**
**Be prepared to explain the reasoning and calculations behind your damages award.**

### Jury Instructions

The judge has given you California’s standard jury instruction on damages for pain and suffering: 

> Reasonable compensation for any pain, discomfort, fears, anxiety and other mental and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff and caused by the injury. 

> No definite standard is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for pain and suffering. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for pain and suffering you should exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix must be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence.

The judge has also instructed you that under California law, a jury cannot reduce damages for lost future earnings for personal injury when those reductions are based on race, gender, or ethnicity.

### Plaintiff Information

_Occupation:_ Stay-at-home parent

_Income:_ None. Prior to deciding to become a stay-at-home parent, Estrada earned $40,000 a year as an office coordinator. The plaintiff decided to stay at home to offset daycare expenses ($30,000 a year) while her children were little (currently ages two and four) and had planned to return to the workforce when children were in school fulltime. The plaintiff had aspirations of going to law school and had purchased a series of LSAT prepbooks.

_Future medical expenses:_ The plaintiff will need ongoing treatment for back injuries. Outside of surgery, expenses for treatment in the past year were $10,000. Treatment should be similar for the rest of plaintiff's natural life (life expectancy of ~40 years). Surgical expenses this year were $100,000. Expert witnesses testified that the plaintiff may not need surgery in the future or may need multiple rounds of surgery at different points in her life.

_Pain and suffering:_ The plaintiff suffers chronic pain daily, has endured multiple surgeries, and future surgery may be necessary. 

Estrada cannot walk more than a few blocks at one time without stopping to rest. She must regularly adjust her sitting position to feel comfortable. The plaintiff feels deep shame and embarrassment for the injury that she sustained and now rarely goes out in public. 

Estrada used to be a member of an indoor soccer team and will never play soccer again. She used to enjoy international travel but she does not feel capable of enduring the pain of sitting in an airplane seat for that stretch of time. Since her injury she has picked up crochet as a hobby, which she enjoys very much.

### Sample Exam Question

You are a judge in the state of Loyola tasked with writing the opinion of the court in the following case. No precedent binds you on the legal issues here, but it is customary to reference the reasoning of decisions from other jurisdictions when deciding an issue of first impression. The facts of the case are as follows:

Luna Adams found that her car's brakes were squeaking. She brought the car in to be seen by her mechanic, Naomi Donald. Donald replaced the brake pads. A week later, Adams was driving when the brakes on her car failed, causing her to run off the road and crash into a tree. Adams sued Donald for personal injuries and property damages. The case went to a jury trial. Adams motioned for summary judgment, under the legal theory that when a car mechanic fixes a part of a car, that mechanic is strictly liable for all injuries proximately caused by that part of the car failing. The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that negligence, not strict liability, governed. The plaintiff appeals the denial of that motion.

### Small group exercise: Litigating your first torts case

### The Facts

On a Tuesday afternoon, Thomas Jenner lost control of the car he was driving and crashed into the side of a bicycle shop. 

His car went through the wall of the bicycle shop, injuring the owner of the bicycle shop, Maxine Hammontree.

It turns out that Thomas Jenner had a history of epilepsy. On this day, he lost control of his car because he had an epileptic seizure and became unconscious. Jenner has no memory of the incident. He remembers driving, and then he remembers being pulled from the vehicle by EMT’s. Jenner reports that prior to the accident there were no warning signs that he was about to have a seizure.

Jenner first began receiving treatment for epilepsy fifteen years ago. He regularly takes anti-seizure medication and has done everything his doctors have advised him to do to address his epilepsy. As a result of his condition, he needs a doctor to sign off yearly with the DMV for him to have a license. His doctor has signed off with the DMV.

Many new cars have automatic collision avoidance systems that can help prevent these kinds of accidents from occurring. The car will automatically brake to prevent a forward collision from happening. Thomas Jenner was driving a 2020 GM Spark that did not have this anti-collision system as an available feature.

### The Legal Questions

1. Who  — if anyone — should be held liable for these injuries to the plaintiff?
2. What kind of remedy should the plaintiff receive?

### Potential Defendants:
1. Thomas Jenner

2. Thomas Jenner's Doctor

3. General Motors

### The Lawyers for the Plaintiff 

Why should this defendant be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

What remedy does the defendant owe Ms. Hammontree?

### The Lawyers for the Defendants

Why should your client not be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

If your client is found liable, what remedy should they owe Ms. Hammontree?

### Explain your reasoning 
You must appeal to some kind of general rule or principle that would apply in similar cases.
