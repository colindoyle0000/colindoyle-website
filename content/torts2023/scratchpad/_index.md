**Exercise 1**

You are a Justice in the Supreme Court of Nebraska who was part of the majority in *Heins v. Webster County*. 

A recent case has made its way through the lower courts.

A plaintiff was playing on an outdoor asphalt YMCA basketball court, fell, and was injured. The plaintiff was not a member of the YMCA and did not pay dues to the YMCA. The plaintiff sued the YMCA before the *Heins* opinion was issued. Following the traditional view, the trial court found the plaintiff to be a licensee and issued a directed verdict for the defendant finding that the defendant did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff. After the case was appealed, the Supreme Court of Nebraska issued the *Heins* opinion, and the court of appeals reversed finding that the defendant owed a duty of care.

The author of the dissenting opinion in *Heins* writes you a letter reminding you that, following the *Heins* majority, the YMCA is now subject to lawsuits holding them to a duty to treat uninvited users of their facilities with the same standard of care as the paying members of their institutions. The majority opinion “socializes the use of privately owned property.” “From this moment on, public and private institutions, as well as residential homeowners, must be especially aware of unknown, uninvited individuals who take advantage of their land and facilities.”

How do you respond?

Please note that your response here is a letter to a colleague. You are not writing a legal opinion. You are writing a response to a colleague who is concerned about the social consequences of the *Heins* opinion. Assume that your letter will be preserved and may be made public at some point in the future.

**Exercise 2**

You are a trial court judge in the state of Loyola. The facts of a case before you are as follows. A patient had been diagnosed as legally blind and had stopped driving as a result. At a routine eye appointment, the patient’s optometrist told him that his vision had improved enough for him to drive again. The patient resumed driving and shortly thereafter crashed into a horse-drawn hay trailer, killing one passenger and injuring the other four. 

The passengers have sued the optometrist for negligence. The optometrist has moved for summary judgment on the grounds that she had no duty to the plaintiffs. 

How would you rule on the motion? Include your reasoning. You should be aware that the Supreme Court of Loyola recently adopted the holding and reasoning of the *Tarasoff* opinion regarding a psychiatrist’s duty to third parties.

### Ross v. Benson

You are an appellate court judge in the state of Loyola. The following case comes to you on appeal from a trial court. You should take notes on the opinion that you would write in this case and be prepared to share your thoughts with the class.

The plaintiff, a nine-year-old named Ronnie Ross, was injured when an SUV belonging to the defendant, Idris Benson, ran him over, causing serious physical injury. The Benson family — Idris, his husband, and their twin nine-year-old children — was visiting the Ross family — Ronnie and his parents — at their home for lunch. Both families planned to attend a children’s birthday party at another family’s home later that afternoon. After eating lunch, the Bensons offered to drive Ronnie to the birthday party so that Ronnie’s parents could take their time cleaning up from lunch and could join them later. The Ross family agreed and told Ronnie to behave himself.

As the Benson family and Ronnie left the house, Idris Benson remotely unlocked his car, a 4-door SUV, that was parked in the Ross’s driveway, directly behind the Ross’s car. The driveway is on a moderate incline, and there was about five feet of space between the back of Benson’s car and a residential street. As the adults gathered birthday presents from the Ross’s house, the three children ran ahead and hopped in the backseat of the car. At trial, the children each testified that none of them got in the front seat, that none of them touched any of the control mechanisms of the car, and that “something clicked in the front and the car started rolling” backwards in the direction of the street. One of the Benson children opened the door and told the others to jump out. All three of the children jumped out. When Ronnie jumped out, he fell, and the front wheel of the SUV ran over him, causing serious injury. 

At trial, the plaintiff introduced no evidence as to the condition of the brakes, whether the handbrake had been set, or what gear the car was in. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent and that the doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* applies. At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the trial court ordered a directed verdict for the defendant finding that *res ipsa loquitur* does not apply and that the plaintiff failed to present a prima facie case of negligence. The plaintiff now appeals.

### Noriega v. Loyola State Fair

Every year, the Loyola State Fair includes a dunk tank as one of the fair activities. The governor of the state and other high officials take turns sitting in the dunk tank while fairgoers pay money to throw baseballs to try to dunk the government official. The dunk tank consists of a seat suspended over a large tank of water. This seat is connected to a target mechanism, which is connected to a bullseye target beside the dunk tank. If a fairgoer hits the target with a baseball, a mechanism releases the seat and the person sitting is dropped into the water below. There’s a metal and wire cage to protect the person in the dunk tank from any stray baseballs. There is also a large net behind the dunk tank to catch any balls that are thrown. 

At this year’s state fair, the dunk tank proved to be a popular attraction. When the governor took a turn on the seat and risked being dunked in the water, a sizable crowd gathered around the dunk tank. State Fair employees roped off an area keeping all fairgoers twenty feet away from the dunk tank and five feet behind where the participants threw balls at the target.

A participant’s errant throw missed the target, ricocheted off of the metal bar at the top of the cage protecting the governor, and rebounded back into the crowd of people watching the dunk tank spectacle. The baseball hit the plaintiff, Matthew Noriega, in the face, causing physical injuries.

Noriega is considering suing the Loyola State Fair for negligence. You’re a junior attorney working at a plaintiff-side firm that is evaluating the merits of Noriega’s case agains the state fair. A partner at the firm would like you to deliver a memo detailing potential theories of negligence that could be argued in this case. For each argument, you should include:
- what constituted reasonable care under the circumstances, and why, and how the defendant failed to exercise that duty of reasonable care
- what the defense’s best counterarguments would be
- in your estimation, how strong of a theory of negligence this is

Here is some additional information that may help you as you develop your arguments:

- A statute requires all dunk tanks to have a safety cage surrounding the person sitting on the seat suspended over the tank of water.
- State fair employees positioned the dunk tank in an area of the fair without any activities or people behind the dunk tank so that balls thrown past the target would be safely caught by the net and balls thrown outside of the net would be unlikely to hit anyone.
- Rather than use baseballs, a small number of carnival proprietors use softer balls made of poly-plastic material. These balls are less popular for dunk tanks because fairgoers prefer to throw baseballs. The poly-plastic balls cannot be thrown with the same force and sometimes do not trigger the seat-release mechanism even after hitting the target.
- Dunk tanks have resulted in injuries in the past, including at the Loyola State Fair. These injuries were due to the release mechanism injuring the person sitting in the dunk tank, the thrower injuring themselves while throwing the baseball, the thrower accidentally hitting a fairgoer with the baseball when a fairgoer wandered between the thrower and the target, and fairgoers slipping and falling in the pools of water that tend to accumulate on the ground beside the dunk tank.
- A recent regulation requires all recreational baseball fields in the state to put up netting between the baseball field and any places where spectators typically gather.

Do not research additional facts or laws when writing this memo. In your memo, you may include information that would be helpful for your firm to learn for developing any of your arguments.

### May v. Wrecking Crew Co.

You are a Supreme Court Justice in the State of Loyola Supreme Court, hearing a case on appeal. Your small group represents the entire Loyola Supreme Court. 

Bowlmoreandup is a three-story bowling alley. At the time of the accident that prompted this litigation, Bowlmoreandup was under renovation. As part of the construction project, there was an open shaft in the center of the building for work crews to ferry supplies and debris throughout the building. A bowling ball placed a foot from the edge of the top of the shaft on the third floor fell into the shaft and landed on the building’s owner, Anita May, causing serious physical injuries. 

May sued two sets of contractors and the construction company, Wrecking Crew Co., for negligence. She claim that the first set of contractors negligently pushed the bowling ball causing it to roll into the open shaft, that the second set of contractors negligently placed the bowling ball too close to the open shaft, and that Wrecking Crew Co. negligently failed to fence around the shaft as required by law. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, finding all of the defendants negligent. The Loyola Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s ruling.

The only issue on appeal to this court is whether the trial court correctly found that one of the defendants, Wrecking Crew Co., was negligent as matter of law for violating a statute. The possibility of Anita May’s negligence in standing beneath an open shaft of a construction site is not an issue on this appeal.

Section 241, subdivision 5, of the Loyola Labor Law (as it stood at the time of the accident) contained the following provisions: “If elevators, elevating machines or hod-hoisting apparatus are used within a building in the course of construction, for the purpose of lifting materials to be used, the shafts or openings in each floor shall be inclosed or fenced in on all sides by a barrier of suitable height, except on two sides which may be used for taking off and putting on materials, and those sides shall be guarded by an adjustable barrier not less than three nor more than four feet from the floor and not less than two feet from the edges of such shafts or openings.”

The undisputed facts are that the openings in each floor were protected by a fence consisting of four vertical metal rods of four feet in height placed at the edges of the opening and three horizontal plastic rings wrapped around the rods and placed one foot apart vertically starting one foot from the ground. From the trial court proceedings, it is unclear whether the rings were actual hula hoops purchased from a children’s toy store or whether the rings only resembled hula hoops.

In contesting the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, Wrecking Crew Co. argued that the legislative history of Section 241 is dispositive. In recommending the enactment of Section 241, the Joint Legislative Committee on Labor Safety stated that the proposed law “should be called ‘Doyle’s Law’ and receive universal approval from the legislature following the unfortunate incident in which a law professor wandering around a construction site lost in thought about the relationship between statutes and reasonable care fell into an unprotected floor opening and died of his injuries.”

How do you rule? Your group is welcome to have a majority opinion, concurring opinons, and dissenting opinions.

### Oral argument: Appealing a Punitive Damages Award

### Hershovitz v. Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies

When we reconvene for class on Tuesday, we will moot oral arguments for a case on appeal before the Loyola Supreme Court. 

Odd-numbered groups (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) are attorneys for the plaintiff.
Even-numbered groups (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) are attorneys for the defendant.

On Tuesday, I will cold call students at random to present their arguments. I will ask follow-up questions, and I will call on students representing the opposing side to address the points that have been made.

The only legal issue on appeal in this case is whether the punitive damages award is excessive and would deprive the defendant of its property without due process of law.

*Use* the legal tests we just went over in class.
*Draw* upon and *analogize to* the reasoning from these cases.

The facts of the case:

Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies is a national pizza chain that promises to deliver pizzas within fifteen minutes or it is free. As a result of this policy, their delivery drivers get in a lot of car accidents. The plaintiff, Scott Hershovitz, suffered minor injuries when a Speedy Pete’s delivery driver rear-ended him at a stop sign while out for delivery. The accident occurred in the state of Loyola.

Hershovitz sued Speedy Pete’s in Loyola state court for negligence. A jury found Speedy Pete’s liable and awarded Hershovitz both compensatory and punitive damages.

Compensatory damages: $15,000 <br>
Punitive damages: $314,159

For considering punitive damages, the jury heard testimony from Speedy Pete’s workers within the state of Loyola and within the state of Nebraska, where Speedy Pete’s is headquartered. The Loyola-located workers testified to management imposing strict rules about delivery drivers delivering on time, including punishments like docked pay. The Nebraska-located workers testified to the Speedy Pete’s national office instructing managers across the country: 1) to tell their delivery drivers to obey all traffic laws, and to follow up this instruction with a playful wink (or wink emoji if the instruction was communicated over text); and 2) to tell their delivery drivers that if they got in a car accident they should remove the *Speedy Pete’s Pizza Pies* decal from the side of their vehicle and tell any people they injured, “I'm so sorry. My blood sugar is running low, which is why I bought all of these pizzas that are in my car. I would love to give you a free slice if you could write your signature on this waiver of liability I just happen to have on me.”

The delivery driver who injured Hershovitz testified that she did remember receiving these instructions, but forgot to follow them exactly. After rear-ending Hershovitz, the driver removed the car decal, offered Hershovitze a slice of pizza but did not ask him to sign a waiver of liability. When he asked her why she hit him, she told him that she worked for Speedy Pete’s and had been rushing to deliver a pizza.

In the State of Loyola, Speedy Pete’s could face civil penalties of up to $100,000 for instructing employees to hide that they were working for their employer in the event of an accident. In other states like Nebraska, Speedy Pete’s would not face civil penalties.

The State of Loyola permits a jury to award punitive damages if the defendant’s tortious conduct was “willful and wanton.”

### Arguments from class:

**Plaintiff Arguments**

Willful & wanton - under Loyola State law necessary

- failure to instruct drivers / fraudulent
- ask drivers to break law / drive recklessly
- encourage employees to lie and misinform, avoid culpability

BMV v. Gore

Reprehensibility

​	Most important factor (BMW and State Farm (disanalogy from these two cases: details of reprehensibility analysis))

​	Deviation from normal / reasonable behavior

​	Company policy creates a huge public risk

​	Not purely economical

​	Optimal Deterrence

​		Evading review b/c it is a fraudulent

Ratio

​	Not a categorical brightline

​	Rely on Mathias, bring in concerns of deterrence (huge issue of public safety)

​	Below ratio in Mathias



Comparison

​	Civil penalties in State of Loyola demonstrate willful/wanton/reprehensible

**Defense Arguments**



BMW v. Gore

Reprehensibility

​	Repetition

​		No evidence of repetition

​	Company policy outside the scope

​		Should be focused on the harm to the plaintiff

​		DP violation to punish nationwide policy (State Farm)

​			Nexus of what is defined as reprehensible and the injury that the plaintiff suffered

​	

Ratio

​	21 : 1 far more than what is allowed in State Farm

​		Not one of the few that will exceed ratio and satisfy due process

​			Compensatory damages are big and suffice here

​		Hiding the logo not particularly egregious

​		Not a reasonable relationship between harm and punitive damages

​		Mathias is much closerr to intentional / willful harm

Comparison

​	$100,000 in sanctions - jury acted arbitrarily

​		Direct application

**Jury Exercise**

You are a jury, determining damages in the following case.

The giant donut at Randy's Donuts fell down, crushing the plaintiff, Cindy Estrada. You have already determined that the proprieters of Randy's Donuts are liable for negligence and have calculated compensatory damages for expenses that Estrada has already incurred. But your role as factfinder is not over: 

**You must now determine the plaintiff's compensatory damages for future economic loss and pain and suffering.**
**Be prepared to explain the reasoning and calculations behind your damages award.**

### Jury Instructions

The judge has given you California’s standard jury instruction on damages for pain and suffering: 

> Reasonable compensation for any pain, discomfort, fears, anxiety and other mental and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff and caused by the injury. 

> No definite standard is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for pain and suffering. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for pain and suffering you should exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix must be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence.

The judge has also instructed you that under California law, a jury cannot reduce damages for lost future earnings for personal injury when those reductions are based on race, gender, or ethnicity.

### Plaintiff Information

_Occupation:_ Stay-at-home parent

_Income:_ None. Prior to deciding to become a stay-at-home parent, Estrada earned $40,000 a year as an office coordinator. The plaintiff decided to stay at home to offset daycare expenses ($30,000 a year) while her children were little (currently ages two and four) and had planned to return to the workforce when children were in school fulltime. The plaintiff had aspirations of going to law school and had purchased a series of LSAT prepbooks.

_Future medical expenses:_ The plaintiff will need ongoing treatment for back injuries. Outside of surgery, expenses for treatment in the past year were $10,000. Treatment should be similar for the rest of plaintiff's natural life (life expectancy of ~40 years). Surgical expenses this year were $100,000. Expert witnesses testified that the plaintiff may not need surgery in the future or may need multiple rounds of surgery at different points in her life.

_Pain and suffering:_ The plaintiff suffers chronic pain daily, has endured multiple surgeries, and future surgery may be necessary. 

Estrada cannot walk more than a few blocks at one time without stopping to rest. She must regularly adjust her sitting position to feel comfortable. The plaintiff feels deep shame and embarrassment for the injury that she sustained and now rarely goes out in public. 

Estrada used to be a member of an indoor soccer team and will never play soccer again. She used to enjoy international travel but she does not feel capable of enduring the pain of sitting in an airplane seat for that stretch of time. Since her injury she has picked up crochet as a hobby, which she enjoys very much.

### Sample Exam Question

You are a judge in the state of Loyola tasked with writing the opinion of the court in the following case. No precedent binds you on the legal issues here, but it is customary to reference the reasoning of decisions from other jurisdictions when deciding an issue of first impression. The facts of the case are as follows:

Luna Adams found that her car's brakes were squeaking. She brought the car in to be seen by her mechanic, Naomi Donald. Donald replaced the brake pads. A week later, Adams was driving when the brakes on her car failed, causing her to run off the road and crash into a tree. Adams sued Donald for personal injuries and property damages. The case went to a jury trial. Adams motioned for summary judgment, under the legal theory that when a car mechanic fixes a part of a car, that mechanic is strictly liable for all injuries proximately caused by that part of the car failing. The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that negligence, not strict liability, governed. The plaintiff appeals the denial of that motion.

### Small group exercise: Litigating your first torts case

### The Facts

On a Tuesday afternoon, Thomas Jenner lost control of the car he was driving and crashed into the side of a bicycle shop. 

His car went through the wall of the bicycle shop, injuring the owner of the bicycle shop, Maxine Hammontree.

It turns out that Thomas Jenner had a history of epilepsy. On this day, he lost control of his car because he had an epileptic seizure and became unconscious. Jenner has no memory of the incident. He remembers driving, and then he remembers being pulled from the vehicle by EMT’s. Jenner reports that prior to the accident there were no warning signs that he was about to have a seizure.

Jenner first began receiving treatment for epilepsy fifteen years ago. He regularly takes anti-seizure medication and has done everything his doctors have advised him to do to address his epilepsy. As a result of his condition, he needs a doctor to sign off yearly with the DMV for him to have a license. His doctor has signed off with the DMV.

Many new cars have automatic collision avoidance systems that can help prevent these kinds of accidents from occurring. The car will automatically brake to prevent a forward collision from happening. Thomas Jenner was driving a 2020 GM Spark that did not have this anti-collision system as an available feature.

### The Legal Questions

1. Who  — if anyone — should be held liable for these injuries to the plaintiff?
2. What kind of remedy should the plaintiff receive?

### Potential Defendants:
1. Thomas Jenner

2. Thomas Jenner's Doctor

3. General Motors

### The Lawyers for the Plaintiff 

Why should this defendant be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

What remedy does the defendant owe Ms. Hammontree?

### The Lawyers for the Defendants

Why should your client not be held liable for the injuries to Maxine Hammontree?

If your client is found liable, what remedy should they owe Ms. Hammontree?

### Explain your reasoning 
You must appeal to some kind of general rule or principle that would apply in similar cases.
