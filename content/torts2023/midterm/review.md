The midterm review memo is available [here](/../../torts2023-material/midterm/midterm_memo_2023_fall.pdf). You can retrieve a copy of your exam answers [here](https://onlineforms.lls.edu/form/torts-exam-return-doyle).

Once you have reviewed your exam, I am more than happy to meet with you individually or in groups to go over your exams. If you finish your review of this exam and still have questions about how to approach an exam for this class, this is great timing for meeting with me one-on-one so that I can understand your approach and coach you for the final.

Before booking a meeting please confirm that you have done the following:

- You have read the midterm review memo in its entirety.
- You have identified the issues that you missed on the exam.
- You have taken notes on how you would rewrite my exam answers if you had the opportunity.
- You understand that, under Loyola Law School policy, your grade cannot be changed unless there was a clerical error in calculating your score.

You can book a one-on-one appointment using [this link](https://fantastical.app/colindoyle0000-CZrJ/midterm-review).
