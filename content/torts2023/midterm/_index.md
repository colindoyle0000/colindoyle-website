The midterm exam will count for 25% of your grade, and the final exam will count for 75%.  The midterm is purposefully weighted less than the final exam to give you the opportunity to improve your work in this class over time. At the start of the spring semester, Iâ€™ll provide feedback on the exam and offer advice for studying for the final exam.

The midterm exam has three parts and two appendices. Part I consists of three short answer questions. Part II consists of a fact pattern and an essay question. Part III consists of a fact pattern and an essay question. The three parts are equally weighted at one-third of your total grade.

Your exam packet will include two appendices. Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendix while you take the exam. 

A copy of the [exam instructions](/../../torts2023-material/midterm/midterm_instructions.pdf) and a copy of the [appendices](/../../torts2023-material/midterm/midterm_instructions.pdf) are available for you to use as you study. These are identical to the instructions and appendices you will receive in your exam packet when you take the exam.
