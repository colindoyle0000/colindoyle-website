The midterm exam will count for 25% of your grade, and the final exam will count for 75%.  The midterm is purposefully weighted less than the final exam to give you the opportunity to improve your work in this class over time. At the start of the spring semester, Iâ€™ll provide feedback on the exam and offer advice for studying for the final exam.

The midterm exam will be a mix of short answer and essay questions.

Your exam packet will include an appendix that includes a list of major cases and legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. You are allowed to consult the appendix while you take the exam. I will provide a copy of the appendix on the course website prior to the exam for you to use as you study.
