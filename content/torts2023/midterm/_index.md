The midterm exam has three parts and two appendices.

Part I consists of four short answer questions. Part II consists of a fact pattern and two related essay questions. Part III consists of a fact pattern and two related essay questions. The three parts are equally weighted at one-third of your total grade.

The midterm exam will count for 25% of your grade, and the final exam will count for 75%.  The midterm is purposefully weighted less than the final exam to give you the opportunity to improve your work in this class over time. At the start of the spring semester, Iâ€™ll provide feedback on the exam and offer advice for studying for the final exam.

Included below are links to PDF versions of the instructions and appendices you will receive when you take the exam. I am providing them here so that you can familiarize yourself with the material before taking the exam.

**Midterm Instructions** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts-material/midterm-instructions.pdf) 


**Midterm Appendices** | [(.pdf)](/../../torts-material/midterm-appendices.pdf) 

Appendix A is a list of cases discussed in-depth during class. Appendix B is a list of legal rules that you are not expected to have memorized. When you take the midterm exam, you will receive a copy of these appendices as part of your exam packet. You are allowed to consult those appendices while you take your exam.
