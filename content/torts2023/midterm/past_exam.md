Last year’s midterm exam is available [here](/../../torts2023-material/past-exam/midterm.pdf). I would encourage you to use the questions on the exam as practice problems as you prepare for the midterm. Keep in mind that last year’s class did not cover exactly the same cases and material.

The midterm review memo is available [here](/../../torts2023-material/past-exam/midterm-memo.pdf). The memo includes my commentary on the questions along with strong student answers.
