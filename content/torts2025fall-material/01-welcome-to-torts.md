# In-Class Exercise

---
On a Tuesday afternoon, Thomas Jenner lost control of the car he was driving and crashed into the side of a bicycle shop.  His car went through the wall of the bicycle shop, injuring the owner of the bicycle shop, Maxine Hammontree.  It turns out that Thomas Jenner had a history of epilepsy. On this day, he lost control of his car because he had an epileptic seizure and became unconscious. Jenner has no memory of the incident. He remembers driving, and then he remembers being pulled from the vehicle by EMT’s. Jenner reports that prior to the accident there were no warning signs that he was about to have a seizure.  

----

Jenner first began receiving treatment for epilepsy fifteen years ago. He regularly takes anti-seizure medication and has done everything his doctors have advised him to do to address his epilepsy. As a result of his condition, he needs a doctor to sign off yearly with the DMV for him to have a license. His doctor has signed off with the DMV.  Many new cars have automatic collision avoidance systems that can help prevent these kinds of accidents from occurring. The car will automatically brake to prevent a forward collision from happening. Thomas Jenner was driving a 2020 GM Spark that did not have this anti-collision system as an available feature.
