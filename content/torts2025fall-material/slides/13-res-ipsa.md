# Syllogism for proving duty and breach

D had a duty (to the plaintiff) to exercise reasonable care when [doing this thing].

Reasonable care under the circumstances was [this thing D should have done], because:

D failed to do [this thing they should have done], therefore D acted negligently / breached their legal duty to plaintiff.
