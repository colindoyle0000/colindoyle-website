### Intentional Torts Exercise

You are a personal injury attorney in the state of Loyola. In Loyola, a protest and counter-protest over gun regulations began to get out of hand. Annie stood at the front lines of the protest arguing for assault weapon regulation, and Bob stood at the front lines of the counter-protest arguing for free assault weapons for public school teachers. The two protests began on opposite sides of city park but grew closer together over the course of the day and were now squaring off face-to-face. Annie started addressing Bob directly. “You think it’s worth it for kids to die so you can pretend you’re a real man? What are you compensating for, buddy? Huh? Wife left you? Maybe instead of buying so many guns, you should buy a gym membership, you fat piece of shit!” As she screamed at him, flecks of spit kept landing on Bob’s face. She pointed her index finger right between his eyes, inches from his face as she said, “No one is ever going to love you.”

---

Bob drew his SIG Sauer P365 pistol from its holster on his hip and pointed it at the ground by his feet. “Back up. Stop spitting on my face. And stop being so mean to me.” “Are you going to shoot me?” Annie asked. “If I have to.” Bob responded. “I’m calling the cops,” Annie said, and retreated back into the crowd.

Annie did not call the cops. But she did sue Bob for assault. Bob has now hired you as his attorney. Having never been sued before, Bob wants you to advise him on his legal options. Please consider any defenses Bob might raise, any intentional tort claims he might have against Annie, and any defenses she might be able to raise. As you advise Bob, be sure to inform him of how strong or weak these claims or defenses are and why. For the purposes of this question, do not consider any negligence or strict liability claims.

### Products Liability Exercise

You are a junior associate at a plaintiff-side firm. A partner at the firm has brought you in to work on an interesting new case. The potential plaintiff, a nine-year-old boy named Augustus Gloop, choked on a hot dog during lunch in his elementary school cafeteria. The child survived — thanks to a gym teacher’s training in first aid and CPR — but suffered serious injuries. His family is now interested in suing Oscar Meyer Weiner, the company that produced this hot dog.

The partner at your firm doesn’t typically litigate products liability cases, so she wants you to catch her up to speed. She’d like you to sketch out arguments supporting a failure to warn claim, a design defect claim, and a manufacturing defect claim. For each claim, provide an example of a piece of evidence that would help our client win. And let her know which claims have the best chance of success. On the failure to warn claim, you should know that Oscar Meyer Weiner does not have any warning labels on its packaging. The partner would also like you to evaluate any affirmative defenses that Oscar Meyer Weiner might raise.
