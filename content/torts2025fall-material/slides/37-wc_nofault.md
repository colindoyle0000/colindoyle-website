# For alternatives to tort, what types of questions are fair game?

---

# Insurance

For a given fact pattern:
- How does insurance affect (or not affect) the tort litigation?
- How does insurance change incentives of the parties?
- How does insurance change our assessment of the fairness and efficacy of a particular tort law rule?

—

# Workers’ Compensation

For a given fact pattern:
- Can the plaintiff pursue a tort claim or is workers’ compensation the exclusive remedy?
- What can the plaintiff recover from workers’ compensation compared to tort?
- With multiple defendants, what are the plaintiff’s options for redress?

—

# Policy Questions

For a given aspect of tort law:
- How does an alternative to tort fare at addressing a particular problem compared to tort law?
- Should tort law adopt this policy or rule from an alternative to tort?
- In crafting law that addresses personal injury and accidents, what should our values and goals be? What rules should we adopt?

---

# Three Types of Policy Questions

- Explicit (e.g., asking your thoughts on a proposed statutory scheme)
- Common law development
- Substantive tort law rules asks for court to make a policy determination

---

# How to answer a policy question?

- Pay attention to the task specified in the question
- Know that doctrinal rules tell you what the law is, but your job is to argue for what the law should be
- Policy questions are thorny, difficult, wicked problems and should be treated as such
	- There are always tradeoffs, costs and benefits
	- Not all values can be maximized
	- Your job is to argue for the optimal balance, not to argue that all goals have been achieved
- Opportunity to bring in theory (corrective justice, law and econ, etc.), but good answers ground that theory in the particulars of the question.

# No-Fault Systems / Compensation Funds

Common features:
- Narrow category of injury
- Reduced fact-finding and proof requirements
- Fixed recovery amounts
- Insurance-like funding rather than individual defendant-to-plaintiff payouts
