# Warnings

---

# What are our concerns with the effectiveness of warnings and warning labels?

- Clarity of labels
- Too much text
- Level of detail related to the possible harm
- Language and legalese / What languages?
- Location of label
- Overwarning
- Color and font, visibility

# Couple nuances

“Heeding Presumption”

Warnings can’t overcome design defects

# How can you defend against a strict liability or products liability claim?

# Plaintiff’s failure to discover a defect

**Restatement (Second) of Torts**
Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense when such negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect in the product, or to guard against the possibility of its existence.

**Restatement Third**
[W]hen the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to discover a defect, there must be evidence that the plaintiff’s conduct in failing to discover a defect did, in fact, fail to meet a standard of reasonable care. In general, a plaintiff has no reason to expect that a new product contains a defect and would have little reason to be on guard to discover it.
