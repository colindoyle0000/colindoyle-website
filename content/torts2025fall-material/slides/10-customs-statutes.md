# Negligence as a Cause of Action

Plaintiff must prove four elements:

1. Duty
2. Breach
3. Causation
4. Harm

---

# Proving Negligence

To establish that the defendant’s conduct fell below standard of reasonable care, plaintiff needs to prove:

1. What defendant did or did not do.

2. What defendant should have done.


---

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability
\- The Reasonable Person
\- Custom
\- Statute 

**Special Considerations**
\- Judge and jury relationship


---

## Judges & Juries

## Rules vs. Standards

Rules are rigid, bright-line tests that are easily applied to facts

Standards offer guidance for decisions but allow discretion

---

# Tradeoffs

**Rules**
Promote predictability, certainty, consistency
Helpful for guiding future behavior

**Standards**
Promote fairness, flexibility, sensitivity to circumstances
Helpful for individualized judging of past behavior

# The T.J. Hooper

“Tugboats and Radios”

# Martin v. Herzog

“The Buggy Without Lights” 

---

# Legal jargon

Prima facie case of negligence

Negligence per se

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

# Tedla v. Ellman

“Walking on the Side of the Highway”

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute
\----------------------------------------------------
**Shield for disproving negligence**
Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care
\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---



# Outlining example

Under the topic of using statutes to establish reasonable care:

— Did the defendant violate a statute?
—– Was statute intended to prevent this kind of harm?
—– To this class of people?
—– BUT consider:
——– Absurd results? 
——– Really about safety? 
——– Exceptions or unusual circumstances?



---



# Short exercise

Write the dissent in *Tedla v. Ellman*.

Explain why *Martin v. Herzog* controls and therefore plaintiffs were negligent as a matter of law.
