# Damages Generally

(core principles, things to keep in mind that come up over and over again)

## Legal Issues

ONLY IF LIABILITY HAS BEEN DETERMINED

## Compensatory Damages

Were the compensatory damages excessive?

Cogntive awareness necessary?

Are pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life separate?

## Punitive Damages

Were the punitive damages excessive such that they violated due process?

Are punitive damages allowed at all?

​	State statute

​	IF NO statute, common law, generally only available for willful wanton misconduct

BMW v. Gore 3 Guideposts:

1. Reprehensibility

   ​		Repeat offenses

   ​		Jurisdiction

   ​			Can’t punish for actions in other states

   ​			Can use out-of-state conduct for reprehensibility of action in this state

   ​				If legal in other state, watch out!

   ​			Type of harm (economic or dignitary or physical)

   ​			 

2. Ratio (single digit - State Farm)

3. Comparison

   ​			How is conduct punished in state?

   ​				Marker of how bad it is (speaks to reprehensibility)

   ​				If not in other states, speaks against reprehensibility

   ​				Notice

Due process concerns:

- Notice
- Proportionality / Excessiveness
