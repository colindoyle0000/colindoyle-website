# Exercise: Opposite holdings 

Develop arguments for the opposite holdings from the holdings you just read in *Adams v. Bullock* and *Braun v. Buffalo*. 

For *Adams*, develop the strongest argument that the jury verdict should be upheld because the defendant did not exercise reasonable care. 

For *Braun*, develop the strongest argument that the defendant was not negligent as a matter of law because the defendant did exercise reasonable care.
