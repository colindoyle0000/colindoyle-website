# Comparative Negligence Exercise

Plaintiff A has suffered $100,000 of damages in a car accident with B, C, and D.

A now sues B, C, and D for negligence.

Comparative fault of the parties: A - 40%, B - 30%, C - 10%, D - 20%

# If multiple defendants are liable, how much are they each paying?

---

# Doctrine of Contribution

**Traditional Common Law Approach**

Two versions:

1. Joint and several liability
2. Several liability

---

# Apportionment based on factual cause

---

# Don’t 

# forget about 

# factual cause!


---

# Don’t forget about factual cause!

Tortfeasors are only liable for the injuries they caused.



---

# Order of operations with multiple injuries and multiple liable defendants

**First step:**

Separate injuries based on factual cause.

**Second step:**

For injuries that multiple defendants caused, sort out liability based on the contribution rule in the jurisdiction.


---

# Doctrine of Contribution

**Traditional Common Law Approach**

Example: 

Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.

Joint and several liability jurisdiction

A, B, C, and D have plenty of money

Who pays what?

# Doctrine of Contribution

**Modern Approach**

Apportionment based on comparative fault.

Example: Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.

A is 40% at fault.

B is 10% at fault.

C is 20% at fault.

D is 30% at fault.

# Doctrine of Contribution

**Modern Approach**

Apportionment based on comparative fault.

Example: Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.

A is 40% at fault. So A owes $40k.

B is 10% at fault. So B owes $10k.

C is 20% at fault. So C owes $20k.

D is 30% at fault. So D owes $30k.

# What about vicarious liability?

# Vicarious liability and the doctrine of contribution

**Modern Approach**

Apportionment based on comparative fault.

Example: Four defendants (A, B, C, and D) with $100k damages.

A is 40% at fault.

B is 10% at fault.

C is 20% at fault.

D is 30% at fault.

E is vicariously liable for D’s negligence.

# Discussion Questions

Given the facts of these cases, what would a just outcome in each case have been?

How capable is our legal system of producing just outcomes in these cases? How does it fall short? What would need to change?
