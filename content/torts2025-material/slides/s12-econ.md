# United States v. Carroll Towing Co.

A workable formula for reasonable care?

---

# BPL

B = Burden of precautionary measures

P = Probability of loss/harm

L = Magnitude of loss/harm

IF B < PL 

AND defendant did not take on B

THEN defendant was negligent

IF B > PL

AND defendant did not take on B

THEN defendant was NOT negligent

## BPL Example

Robot food delivery company with a 50% chance of causing $200k in damage to a pedestrian each year. (P * L = $100k). Reducing robots speed is available as a possible precaution. Would reduce 100% of the harm to the pedestrian at cost of $200k to to the company. The company does not reduce the speed of its robots. Was the company negligent?

| Defendant’s Precaution | Cost of Precaution | Expected Cost to Plaintiff | Total Cost to Society |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No Precaution          | $0                 | $100k                      | $100k                 |
| Reduced speed          | $200k              | $0                         | $200k                 |

# BPL Example

Same facts as before. But now additional sensors for the robot is available as a possible precaution. Would reduce 50% of the harm to plaintiff at cost of $30k to the company. The company takes no precautions. Was the company negligent?

| Defendant’s Precaution | Cost of Precaution | Expected Cost to Plaintiff | Total Cost to Society |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No Precaution          | $0                 | $100k                      | $100k                 |
| Reduced speed          | $200k              | $0                         | $200k                 |
| Added sensors          | $30k               | $50k                       | $80k                  |

## Economic Theory of Negligence

\- Fault = economic inefficiency

\- Embodies a trust in private ordering and economic incentives

\- Driven by a goal of maximizing overall economic welfare

## Critiques of Economic Theory

\- Incommeasurability of harms

\- Uncertainty of cost calculations

---

# Negligence as a Cause of Action

Plaintiff must prove four elements:

1. ??????????
2. ??????????
3. ??????????
4. ??????????

---

# Negligence as a Cause of Action

Plaintiff must prove four elements:

1. Duty
2. Breach
3. Causation
4. Harm

---

## Prima facie case of negligence

On its face, plaintiff has met the burden of proving duty, breach, causation, and harm.

Doesn’t mean plaintiff wins! Just means that a jury *could* find for the plaintiff.

---

# Negligence as a Concept

Relates to the elements of duty and breach

The “fault” principle

Defined as a failure to exercise “reasonable care”

---

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- ??????????

\- ??????????

\- ??????????

\- ??????????

\- ??????????

**Special Considerations**

\- ??????????

---

**Ways to determine reasonable care under the circumstances include:**

\- Foreseeability

\- The Reasonable Person

\- Custom

\- Statute

\- Cost-Benefit Analysis (Hand Formula: B < P\*L)

**Special Considerations**

\- Judge and jury relationship

---

# Foreseeability

Foreseeability is a flexible concept.

Define any event in general enough terms and it is foreseeable.

Define any event in narrow enough terms and it is unforeseeable.

---

# Reasonable Person Standard

An objective standard designed to clarify what reasonable care requires.

**Exceptions to objective standard**:

\- Physical disability

\- Children

\- Expertise

**Not exceptions to objective standard**

\- Mental disability

\- Children engaged in adult activity

\- Old age & infirmity

---

# How to use customs and statutes

**Sword for proving negligence**

Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care

\- Defendant failed to comply with custom or statute

\----------------------------------------------------

**Shield for disproving negligence**

Prove two things:

\- Custom or statute = reasonable care

\- Defendant complied with custom or statute

---

# Negligence per se

\- Actor violates a statute that is designed to protect against this type of accident and harm

AND

\- the accident victim is within the class of persons the statute is designed to protect.

---

## Economic theory of negligence

**Hand Formula**

B = Burden of precautionary measures

P = Probability of loss/harm

L = Magnitude of loss/harm

IF B < PL 

AND defendant did not take on B

THEN defendant was negligent

IF B > PL

AND defendant did not take on B

THEN defendant was NOT negligent

# Noriega v. Loyola State Fair

Assignment: Deliver a memo detailing potential theories of negligence that could be argued in this case. For each argument, you should include:

- What constituted reasonable care under the circumstances, and why, and how the defendant failed to exercise that duty of reasonable care

- What the defense’s best counterarguments would be

- In your estimation, how strong of a theory of negligence this is
